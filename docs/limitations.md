# Limitations and Support

## Limitations (as of Q2 2025)

- **Competency Stability**: Any competency may not always work the same way. Be extra careful and correct the behavior as needed.
- **Model Compatibility**: Using models such as GPT 4.1 does not work well and may even break important files. There is no guarantee that it will work with other models either.
- **User Expertise**: We recommend avoiding providing OLAF to untrained users. It can do more harm than good for those who do not understand the concept of LLMs.
- **Context Management**: The way the agent manages and interferes with context strongly impacts results. If you use your own agents, be extra careful with aspects such as ephemeral memory.
- **Language Support**: We only tested in Globish (basic English). Translating competencies into another language may not deliver the same results. Be careful.
- **Vendor Independence**: Although we tried to make it non-vendor dependent, there may still be some remnants from our first incarnation.
- **Directory Structure**: The structure used to store artifacts produced by prompts is just an example, but prompts are affected if you change folder names.
- **Project Management**: We did not intend to deliver project management features. Use MCP servers to get JIRA (or similar) or Confluence (or similar) data.
