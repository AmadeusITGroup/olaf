# Create specialized agents
research_analyst_agent = Agent(
    system_prompt="Research specialist for startup markets",
    tools=[web_search, calculator, file_write]
)

# Convert agents into tools
@tool
def research_analyst(query: str) -> str:
    response = research_analyst_agent(query)
    return str(response)

# Orchestrator delegates to specialists
executive_assistant = Agent(tools=[research_analyst, travel_advisor])
```
