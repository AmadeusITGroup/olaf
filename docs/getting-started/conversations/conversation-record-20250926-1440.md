# Detailed Conversation Narrative: 20250926-1440

## Conversation Information
- **Date:** 20250926
- **Time:** 14:33-14:41 (CEDT)
- **AI Models Used:** Sonnet 4
- **Team Members:** USER, Cascade (Sonnet 4)
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate how to create a new prompt and place it in the OLAF library for reuse

## Creating a New Prompt for OLAF Library

**USER said:** "create prompt"

**Cascade said:** I'll help you create a new prompt. Based on the competency index, I'm using the "prompt-engineer/create-prompt.md" workflow with the "Act" protocol.

Let me first check the current prompt creation workflow to understand the process and list available sub-categories for organization.

**Cascade did:**
1. Read the prompt creation workflow: `olaf-core/prompts/prompt-engineer/create-prompt.md`
2. Listed available sub-categories in `olaf-core/prompts/` directory
3. Presented the required parameters to the user:
   - user_request (REQUIRED)
   - prompt_name (REQUIRED, max 4 words, kebab-case)
   - sub_category (REQUIRED, from available options)
   - reuse_flag (OPTIONAL, default: true)

## Gathering Prompt Requirements

**USER said:** 
1. The prompt is about reading a folder of code and configuration files that the user must provide as entry, and to generate documentation for newcomers. It should use a template to be created so that each time we use this prompt the output is the same format. The documentation should be in 2 parts: Functional, then technical.
2. Learn-from-code
3. This is a competency for Coders
4. yes

**Cascade said:** Perfect! I have all the required parameters and will proceed with the workflow following the Propose-Confirm-Act protocol.

**Cascade did:**
1. Validated parameters:
   - user_request: Generate newcomer documentation by analyzing code and configuration files
   - prompt_name: learn-from-code
   - sub_category: developer/ (for coders)
   - reuse_flag: yes
2. Read template and principles files:
   - `olaf-core/templates/prompt-engineer/prompt-template.md`
   - `olaf-core/templates/prompt-engineer/prompting-principles.md`
3. Checked for existing similar prompts in developer/ sub-category
4. Confirmed no duplication with existing `generate-tech-spec-from-code.md`

## Prompt Design and Creation

**Cascade said:** Based on the Propose-Confirm-Act protocol, I'll present the complete prompt for your review, including both the main prompt and a supporting template for consistent output formatting.

**Cascade did:**
1. Generated complete prompt following OLAF template structure with:
   - Framework validation section
   - Time retrieval requirements
   - Input parameters (code_folder_path, project_name, target_audience, output_filename)
   - User interaction protocol (Act)
   - Structured process (Validation → Execution → Validation)
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Success criteria checklist
2. Created supporting documentation template with:
   - Functional documentation section (business logic, features, workflows)
   - Technical documentation section (architecture, setup, troubleshooting)
   - Consistent formatting structure
3. Presented both files for user approval

## User Approval and File Creation

**USER said:** "yes"

**Cascade said:** Perfect! I'll now create both the prompt and template files.

**Cascade did:**
1. Created newcomer documentation template: `olaf-core/templates/developer/newcomer-documentation-template.md`
2. Created the learn-from-code prompt: `olaf-core/prompts/developer/learn-from-code.md`
3. Validated both files were successfully created
4. Provided completion summary with validation checklist

**Files created:**
- `olaf-core/templates/developer/newcomer-documentation-template.md`
- `olaf-core/prompts/developer/learn-from-code.md`

## Storing the Conversation Record

**USER said:** "store conversation"

**Cascade said:** I'll store this conversation record using the "store-conversation-record" competency with the "Act" protocol.

**Cascade did:**
1. Read the store conversation workflow: `olaf-core/prompts/project-manager/store-conversation-record.md`
2. Generated timestamp: 20250926-1440
3. Validated file location via memory map: `olaf-data/product/documentations/conversations/`
4. Read conversation record template: `olaf-core/templates/project-manager/conversation-record-template.md`
5. Requested AI model information from user

**USER said:** "Sonnet 4. I want to demonstrate how one can create a new prompt, place it in the library for reuse. I want to share this with new olaf users"

**Cascade said:** Perfect! I'll create the conversation record documenting how to create a new prompt for the OLAF library, using "Sonnet 4" as the AI model. This will serve as a demonstration for new OLAF users.

**Cascade did:**
1. Created this comprehensive conversation record capturing the complete prompt creation workflow
2. Documented all steps from initial request to final file creation
3. Structured the record to serve as a tutorial for new OLAF users

**Files created:**
- `olaf-data/product/documentations/conversations/conversation-record-20250926-1440.md`

## Summary of All Files Created or Modified

### Files Created:
1. `olaf-core/templates/developer/newcomer-documentation-template.md` - Template for consistent newcomer documentation format
2. `olaf-core/prompts/developer/learn-from-code.md` - Main prompt for generating newcomer documentation from code analysis
3. `olaf-data/product/documentations/conversations/conversation-record-20250926-1440.md` - This conversation record for new user demonstration

### Key Learning Points for New OLAF Users:
1. **Use Competency Index**: Always start with "create prompt" to trigger the proper workflow
2. **Follow Structure**: OLAF prompts follow a strict template with Framework Validation, Time Retrieval, Input Parameters, Process phases, Error Handling, and Success Criteria
3. **Create Supporting Templates**: When prompts need consistent output, create templates in the appropriate templates directory
4. **Organize by Role**: Place prompts in role-specific subdirectories (developer/, project-manager/, etc.)
5. **Use Kebab-Case**: Prompt names must follow kebab-case convention with max 4 words
6. **Document Everything**: Store conversation records to help future users understand the creation process
