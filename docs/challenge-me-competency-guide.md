#### Cycle Example

**Cycle 1: Analysis Phase**
```
=== CYCLE 1 ===

ANALYSIS: Your current thinking focuses on REST vs GraphQL vs event-driven patterns. Let me examine your codebase and research to challenge this approach.

CODEBASE FINDINGS:
- Found 3 REST services using different authentication patterns
- Event bus implementation in /services/notification-service
- No GraphQL implementations detected
- Inconsistent error handling across services

DOCUMENTATION REVIEW:
- Architecture decision record favors REST for CRUD operations
- Event-driven pattern documented for async workflows
- No GraphQL evaluation found in decision records

WEB RESEARCH:
- Latest industry trends show hybrid approaches gaining traction
- Performance considerations for different patterns
- Team expertise requirements vary significantly

COLLABORATIVE CHALLENGES:

ðŸ¤” **Challenge 1: Pattern Consistency Strategy**
Your codebase shows inconsistent REST implementations. How do you plan to address this?

**A)** Standardize on the UserController authentication pattern across all services
**B)** Create new unified patterns and migrate existing services
**C)** Leave existing patterns and only standardize new services
**D)** I haven't considered the consistency issue yet

*Which approach aligns with your timeline and resources?*

ðŸ’¡ **Challenge 2: GraphQL Learning Curve**
You mention GraphQL but your team has no experience with it:

**1.** Invest in training and start with simple queries
**2.** Hire GraphQL expertise or consultants
**3.** Use GraphQL gateway tools to reduce complexity
**4.** Postpone GraphQL until team is ready

*What's your preferred strategy for building GraphQL capabilities?*

ðŸ”„ **Challenge 3: Event-Driven Evolution**
Your event bus is partially implemented:

**A)** Complete the current event-driven implementation first
**B)** Start fresh with a more comprehensive event architecture
**C)** Extend existing event bus incrementally
**D)** Focus on other patterns and revisit events later

*Which path makes most sense given your current investment?*

INSIGHTS BASED ON YOUR RESPONSES:
1. API gateway pattern could unify different service patterns
2. Hybrid approach: REST for CRUD, events for async, GraphQL for complex queries
3. Your existing event bus could be leveraged rather than replaced

SOURCES CONSULTED:
- /services/auth-service/api/controllers/UserController.java
- /docs/architecture/ADR-001-api-patterns.md
- https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html

Your answers will help me provide more targeted recommendations in the next cycle. What resonates most with you from these questions?
```

### 3. User Response and Continuation
```
User: You're right about the consistency issues. I hadn't considered the hybrid approach. Can you explore how an API gateway would work with our current setup?

- Ask for prioritization of most relevant sources
- Use "shallow" research depth for simpler sessions

**"Citations seem incomplete"**
- The system maintains manual backups if tracking fails
- Request specific source verification during cycles
- Check sources.md for comprehensive citation database

**"Cycles becoming repetitive"**
- Ask for new research angles or unexplored sources
- Request deeper analysis of specific findings
- Consider switching to different documentation areas

### Getting Help
- Use "explain your reasoning" to understand source selection
- Ask "what sources are you consulting?" for transparency
