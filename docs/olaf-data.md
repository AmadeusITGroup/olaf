## Step 1: User Inputs

1. **Core problem or opportunity:**
Most users do not know how to handle prompt engineering. We need to provide tools and examples to simplify this task.

2. **Why is solving this important now?**
We deliver thousands of IDEs with AI agents, but must see benefits—faster delivery, higher quality. If not, we are just spending money for nothing and should spend it elsewhere.

3. **Current process or workflow:**
We try to help through support and training, but it is long and not that profitable.

4. **Where GenAI provides value:**
GenAI can help by providing prompts that help create other prompts, well-structured and documented, using templates and even scripts or MCP server. Meta-prompting can help save prompts for others.

5. **Main users and pain points:**
Developers, testers, and business analysts. They code, create tests and documentation but do not have assistants to review, scaffold, and understand existing code, tests, or documents.

6. **Expected outcomes:**
(Not provided)

7. **Tried or considered solutions:**
No solution exists that we know. Training is one, but we believe it is only by exercising that people will learn.

8. **Why previous solutions did not meet needs:**
They help, but newcomers are not trained, and trainers are also not experts in most cases.

9. **Expected business benefits and target market:**
We should expect an increase in the time to deliver fixes or new evolution to shorten by at least 5% in the coming 12 months.

10. **Data, compliance, or integration constraints:**
Many, as GenAI is very much disputed on human factors, security, and legal. But the market at large is embracing these solutions.

## Step 3: Alternatives and Challenges

### Key Points Summary
* Most users struggle with prompt engineering; need for tools and examples.
* AI agent adoption must show measurable benefits (speed, quality) or investment is wasted.
* Current support/training is slow and not profitable.
* GenAI/meta-prompting can help create, structure, and share prompts.
* Main users: developers, testers, business analysts—need help with code, tests, docs.
* No known effective solution; training alone is insufficient.
* Market is embracing GenAI despite compliance and legal debates.

### Related Initiatives and Sources
* [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot): AI-powered code completion, chat, and agent modes for developers. Used by companies like Duolingo, Mercedes-Benz, and Mercado Libre to boost productivity and code quality.
* [GitHub Copilot Customer Stories](https://github.com/customer-stories): Real-world examples of AI agent adoption and benefits.
* [GitHub Copilot Advanced Security](https://github.com/security/advanced-security): AI for code security and vulnerability fixes.
* (No relevant results found on Medium or Reddit for meta-prompting tools for non-experts.)

### Key Challenges and Considerations
* Measuring real productivity and quality gains from AI agents.
* Ensuring prompt engineering tools are accessible to non-experts.
* Overcoming resistance to change and lack of prompt engineering expertise.
* Addressing compliance, security, and legal concerns with GenAI.
* Avoiding wasted investment if benefits are not realized.

## Step 4: Challenges

### Potential Challenges and Risks
* **Technical:**
  * Integration with diverse IDEs and workflows
  * Ensuring prompt templates are robust and adaptable
  * Maintaining up-to-date prompt libraries as GenAI evolves
* **Organizational:**
  * Change management and user adoption
  * Training and onboarding for non-experts
  * Measuring and reporting ROI
* **Ethical:**
  * Data privacy and security
  * Bias in AI-generated prompts or code
  * Over-reliance on AI for critical tasks

### Alternative Approaches
* Continue with traditional training and support (slow, not scalable)
* Use only expert-driven prompt engineering (limits accessibility)
* Rely on open-source prompt libraries (may lack support and quality)

**User, please answer:** Why are these alternatives not adapted or acceptable for your context?

**User answer:**
We think we will not have the resources to deliver as many trainings and support as needed to make a fast difference. So we need a way to improve our own knowledge of the topic of prompt engineering and to leverage this for the benefit of users.

### Documented Challenges
See above for technical, organizational, and ethical risks. These must be addressed for successful GenAI adoption.

## Step 5: Conclusion

### Summary
The Olaf initiative aims to empower users and teams with practical prompt engineering tools, templates, and meta-prompting solutions. The goal is to reduce reliance on slow, resource-intensive training and support, and instead leverage shared knowledge and automation to accelerate GenAI adoption and measurable benefits (speed, quality, user enablement).

### Goals
* Make prompt engineering accessible to non-experts
* Improve delivery speed and quality with AI agents
* Reduce support/training burden
* Enable knowledge sharing and reuse of effective prompts

### Alternatives Considered
* Traditional training and support (not scalable)
* Expert-driven prompt engineering (not accessible)
* Open-source prompt libraries (may lack support/quality)

### Recommendation and Next Steps
Proceed with developing and piloting prompt engineering tools and meta-prompting templates. Focus on:
* Building a knowledge base of effective prompts
* Creating user-friendly templates and scripts
* Measuring impact on delivery speed and quality
* Addressing compliance, security, and adoption challenges

If successful, scale the approach and share learnings across teams.
