# Regenerating Data Flow Diagrams from Code

## Overview

This document explains the systematic process for regenerating Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) from existing source code. The process uses a structured 4-phase approach that analyzes code architecture to create comprehensive visual representations of system data flows.

## Purpose

Data Flow Diagrams are essential for:

- **Architecture Understanding**: Visualizing how data moves through a system
- **Security Analysis**: Identifying potential security vulnerabilities and data exposure points
- **Documentation**: Creating up-to-date system documentation from actual code
- **Onboarding**: Helping new team members understand system architecture
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements for data flow documentation

## Process Overview

The DFD generation follows a structured 4-phase approach with 12 distinct steps:

```text
Phase A → Phase B → Phase C → Phase D
(Steps 1-3) → (Steps 4-7) → (Steps 8-9) → (Steps 10-12)
```

Each phase has specific deliverables and requires user validation before proceeding to the next phase.

## Phase A: Initial Analysis (Steps 1-3)

### Step 1: Initial System Understanding

- **Purpose**: Establish foundational knowledge of the application
- **Activities**:
  - Identify application type and primary purpose
  - Examine codebase structure and organization
  - Catalog key technologies, frameworks, and patterns
  - Analyze configuration files and deployment scripts

### Step 2: Context Diagram Creation

- **Purpose**: Define system boundaries and external interactions
- **Activities**:
  - Identify external entities (users, systems, APIs, databases)
  - Map data flows between external entities and the system
  - Create ASCII context diagram
  - Document system interactions

### Step 3: Level 1 DFD Task Planning

- **Purpose**: Prepare detailed execution plan for Level 1 analysis
- **Deliverable**: `DFD_level1_tasks.md` with structured task breakdown

## Phase B: Level 1 Analysis (Steps 4-7)

### Step 4: Level 1 DFD Creation

- **Purpose**: Create the primary data flow diagram showing major processes
- **Activities**:
  - Execute systematic process identification
  - Map major data stores and their purposes
  - Document data flows between processes
  - Create comprehensive Level 1 DFD

### Step 5: Level 1 vs Level 2 Validation

- **Purpose**: Determine if additional detail (Level 2) is needed
- **Decision Point**: Based on system complexity and stakeholder needs

### Step 6: Level 1 Refinement (if needed)

- **Purpose**: Optimize Level 1 diagram based on validation feedback

### Step 7: Level 2 Task Planning

- **Purpose**: Prepare execution plan for detailed Level 2 analysis (if required)

## Phase C: Level 2 Analysis (Steps 8-9)

### Step 8: Level 2 DFD Creation

- **Purpose**: Create detailed decomposition of complex processes
- **Activities**:
  - Break down complex Level 1 processes into sub-processes
  - Map detailed internal data flows
  - Document granular data transformations

### Step 9: Level 2 Validation

- **Purpose**: Ensure Level 2 diagrams accurately represent code implementation

## Phase D: Final Documentation (Steps 10-12)

### Step 10: Final Documentation

- **Purpose**: Consolidate all analysis into comprehensive documentation
- **Deliverables**:
  - Executive summary
  - Technical summary
  - Complete DFD documentation
  - Security analysis (if applicable)

### Step 11: Quality Review

- **Purpose**: Validate accuracy and completeness of all deliverables

### Step 12: Stakeholder Review

- **Purpose**: Final validation with business and technical stakeholders

## Key Features

### Progress Tracking

- **Master Progress File**: `DFD_master_progress.md` tracks overall completion
- **Phase-Specific Tracking**: Detailed task lists for each phase
- **Session Management**: Support for multi-session analysis with handoff notes

### Quality Assurance

- **Mandatory Review Points**: User validation required between phases
- **Systematic Validation**: Each phase validates previous work
- **Completeness Checks**: Comprehensive checklists ensure nothing is missed

### Structured Output

- **ASCII Diagrams**: Text-based diagrams for easy version control
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Business and technical perspectives
- **Traceability**: Clear mapping between code and diagram elements

## File Organization

The process generates several key files:

- `DFD_master_progress.md` - Overall progress tracking
- `[App]_analysis.md` - Main analysis document
- `DFD_level1_tasks.md` - Level 1 task breakdown
- `DFD_level2_tasks.md` - Level 2 task breakdown (if needed)
- `DFD_level_analysis.md` - Final consolidated analysis

## Examples and Samples

See the **[DFD Samples](./dfd-samples/)** folder for real-world examples:

- **[Full Analysis Example](./dfd-samples/code2DFD_analysis.md)** - Complete step-by-step DFD analysis of a real microservice application
- **[Executive Summary](./dfd-samples/dfd-executive-summary.md)** - High-level business overview
- **[Technical Summary](./dfd-samples/dfd-technical-summary.md)** - Detailed technical analysis  
- **[Final Documentation](./dfd-samples/dfd-Final-Documentation.md)** - Complete DFD documentation
- **[User Documentation](./dfd-samples/code2dfd-cli-user-documentation.md)** - Tool usage example

These samples demonstrate the complete DFD generation process applied to a real microservice application (`code2DFD`). The **Full Analysis Example** is particularly valuable as it shows the complete workflow from initial system understanding through final documentation, including:

- Context diagrams with external entities
- Level 1 DFDs with major processes and data flows
- Security analysis and vulnerability identification
- Multi-format output generation (PlantUML, JSON, PNG)

## Benefits

### For Development Teams

- **Automated Documentation**: Generate current architecture diagrams from actual code
- **Onboarding Acceleration**: Visual guides for new team members
- **Architecture Validation**: Ensure implementation matches design intent

### For Security Teams

- **Vulnerability Identification**: Systematic analysis of data exposure points
- **Compliance Support**: Generate required data flow documentation
- **Risk Assessment**: Visual representation of security-critical data paths

### For Business Stakeholders

- **System Understanding**: Clear visualization of business data flows
- **Impact Analysis**: Understand effects of proposed changes
- **Audit Trail**: Documented evidence of system behavior

## Getting Started

1. **Initialize Tracking**: Create `DFD_master_progress.md` file
2. **Phase A**: Begin with initial system analysis
3. **Review Points**: Validate each phase before proceeding
4. **Iterate**: Refine diagrams based on feedback
5. **Document**: Generate final comprehensive documentation

The process is designed to be systematic yet flexible, allowing teams to adapt the level of detail based on their specific needs and system complexity.
