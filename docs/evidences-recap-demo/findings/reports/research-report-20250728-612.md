```
TCO = Infrastructure Cost + Model API Cost + Development Cost + Operational Cost

Where:
- Infrastructure Cost = (Compute + Storage + Network) Ã— Time
- Model API Cost = Token Usage Ã— Token Price Ã— Volume
- Development Cost = Engineer Time Ã— Hourly Rate Ã— Complexity
- Operational Cost = Monitoring + Support + Compliance + Training
```

#### Cost Optimization Strategies
**Token Efficiency**:
- Prompt compression reducing token count by 20-40%
- Intelligent caching achieving 60-80% cache hit rates
- Batch processing improving throughput by 3-5x
- Model right-sizing reducing costs by 25-50% for appropriate tasks

**Infrastructure Optimization**:
```python
def optimize_infrastructure_cost(workload_profile):
    recommendations = []
    
    if workload_profile.peak_to_average_ratio > 3:
        recommendations.append("Use auto-scaling with spot instances")
    
    if workload_profile.cache_hit_rate < 60:
        recommendations.append("Implement Redis cluster caching")
    
    if workload_profile.batch_potential > 50:
        recommendations.append("Implement request batching")
    
    return CostOptimizationPlan(recommendations)
```

### Return on Investment (ROI) Framework

#### Business Value Metrics
**Quantifiable Benefits**:
- **Productivity Improvement**: 25-40% reduction in content creation time
- **Quality Enhancement**: 30-50% improvement in output consistency  
- **Cost Reduction**: 40-60% decrease in manual processing costs
- **Time to Market**: 20-30% faster product development cycles

**ROI Calculation**:
```
ROI = (Business Value - Total Investment Cost) / Total Investment Cost Ã— 100%

Example:
- Annual Business Value: $500,000 (productivity + quality + speed)
- Annual Investment: $200,000 (infrastructure + development + operations)
- ROI = ($500,000 - $200,000) / $200,000 Ã— 100% = 150%
