## Problem Statement & Vision

### Current Challenges
The AI agent ecosystem faces a fundamental interoperability crisis. While individual agents excel at specific tasks, their potential is severely limited by the lack of standardized infrastructure for collaboration. Current challenges include:

- **Framework Isolation**: Agents built on different frameworks cannot communicate effectively
- **Integration Complexity**: Each agent-to-agent interaction requires custom integration work
- **Scalability Barriers**: Absence of standard protocols prevents large-scale multi-agent deployments
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Organizations become dependent on specific agent framework vendors

### AGNTCY Vision
AGNTCY proposes an "Internet of Agents" - an open, interoperable infrastructure that connects AI systems across vendor and organizational boundaries. This vision draws parallels to how the original internet connected computers and the web connected information.

**Core Principles:**
- **Openness**: Open-source development and community governance
- **Interoperability**: Cross-framework and cross-vendor agent collaboration
- **Standardization**: Common protocols and data formats
- **Scalability**: Enterprise-grade security and performance

### Founding Stakeholders
- **LangChain**: Contributes agent orchestration and evaluation expertise
- **Galileo**: Provides agent trust and observability frameworks
- **Cisco**: Offers secure networking infrastructure knowledge
