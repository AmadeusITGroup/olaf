  "description_details": "This critical SSRF vulnerability affects the WADL (Web Application Description Language) service description functionality in Apache CXF. The vulnerability is specifically located in the cxf-rt-rs-service-description module and is triggered when a custom stylesheet parameter is configured for WADL generation. The vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate the styleSheetPath parameter to perform Server-Side Request Forgery attacks. When WADL generation is enabled with custom stylesheets, the server processes the stylesheet parameter without proper validation, allowing attackers to specify arbitrary URLs. This can lead to internal network reconnaissance, data exfiltration, and potential access to internal services that should not be externally accessible. The vulnerability affects all REST webservices built with Apache CXF that have WADL generation enabled with custom stylesheet configuration.",
  "exploitation_scenario": "An attacker would target a REST webservice built with Apache CXF that has WADL service description enabled with custom stylesheet configuration. The attack vector involves crafting malicious requests to the WADL endpoint (typically accessible via ?_wadl parameter) and manipulating the styleSheetPath parameter to point to internal or external resources. For example, an attacker could set the stylesheet parameter to 'http://internal-service:8080/admin' or 'file:///etc/passwd' to probe internal networks or access sensitive files. The server would then make HTTP requests to these targets, potentially exposing internal network topology, service configurations, or sensitive data. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous in cloud environments where internal services may be accessible via predictable URLs or in environments with weak network segmentation.",
  "supply_chain_context": {
    "transitive_risk": "High - Apache CXF is widely used as both direct and transitive dependency in enterprise Java applications, Spring Boot applications, microservices architectures, and various web frameworks. It's commonly included in application servers and middleware platforms.",
    "future_usage_risk": "High - REST APIs and web services are fundamental to modern enterprise applications, microservices architectures, and API-first development approaches. WADL generation is often enabled for API documentation and discovery purposes, making this vulnerability highly relevant for current and future development."
