    "risk_classification": "NOT_EXPOSED",
    "summary": "CVE-2019-20445 affects Netty's HTTP codec components (HttpObjectDecoder, HttpRequestDecoder, HttpResponseDecoder) allowing HTTP request smuggling attacks. Comprehensive pattern-based analysis found no evidence of Netty library usage in the jal-dapi-ext codebase. No vulnerable imports, method invocations, dependency declarations, or framework integrations were detected.",

    "severity": "Critical",
    "affected_component": "io.netty:netty",
    "affected_versions": "< 4.1.44",
    "vulnerability_type": "HTTP Request Smuggling (CWE-444)",
    "cwe": "CWE-444",
    "description": "HttpObjectDecoder.java in Netty before 4.1.44 allows a Content-Length header to be accompanied by a second Content-Length header, or by a Transfer-Encoding header. This vulnerability enables HTTP request smuggling attacks where attackers can send requests with conflicting headers that are interpreted differently by proxy servers and backend servers, potentially allowing cache poisoning, session hijacking, and bypassing security controls."
