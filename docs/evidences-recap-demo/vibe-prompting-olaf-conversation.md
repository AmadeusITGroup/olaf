<human-user-name>: please explain the initilalization , then how a competnecy is found , then how the  interaction protocol works

GitHub Copilot: Here is a concise explanation based on the provided copilot-instructions:

1. Session Initialization:
- At the start of a new session, you must read and apply the following files once:
  - memory-map.md (project structure and file locations)
  - core-principles.md (core behavioral rules)
  - query-competency-index.md (task competency mapping; read the full file)
- This ensures you understand the workspace, rules, and available competencies.

2. How a Competency Is Found:
- Always consult the query-competency-index first.
- If a matching competency is found, apply its protocol directly (Act, Propose-Act, or Propose-Confirm-Act).
- If no clear competency is found, ask the user for clarification before proceeding.

3. Interaction Protocols:
- There are three protocols, determined by the competency:
  - Act: Execute the action directly, no user confirmation needed (default).
  - Propose-Act: Propose the action, wait for user agreement, then act.
  - Propose-Confirm-Act: Propose a detailed plan, wait for user review, ask for final sign-off, then act.
- Each competency specifies which protocol to use; if not specified, use Act.
