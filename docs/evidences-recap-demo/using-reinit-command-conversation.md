GitHub Copilot: I'll reapply the session initialization as instructed. Let me read the required files to initialize the session properly. ## Session Initialization Complete

I have successfully reapplied the session initialization by reading the three critical files:

1. **Memory Map** `[id:memory_map]` - Project structure and file location references
2. **Core Principles** `[id:core_principles]` - Mandatory behavioral rules including:
   - Jobs creation only upon explicit user instruction
   - File naming conventions (verb-entity-complement.md pattern)
   - Timestamp format (YYYYMMDD-HHmm CEDT)
   - US English language requirement
3. **Query Competency Index** `[id:competency_index]` - Complete task competency mapping with 30+ defined workflows

The session is now properly initialized with all reference materials loaded. I'm ready to execute tasks using the delegation protocol hierarchy: competency-first approach with appropriate interaction protocols (Act, Propose-Act, or Propose-Confirm-Act).
