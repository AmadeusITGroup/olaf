In that case i request for "research and report" but using gpt4.1. the initialization sequence may not be respected  but the model understand it needs to find a competency pattern and a protocol to execute the request from the competency index



<human-user-name>: research- and report

GitHub Copilot: I will follow the Olaf Delegation Protocol as described in `[id:copilot-instructions]`.

1. Session Setup: I have already received the workspace structure and the relevant instructions.
2. Competency Index: I will consult `[id:query-competency-index]` to identify the correct workflow for "research- and report".

I will now read the `[id:query-competency-index]` file to identify the matching competency and protocol. Match found in `[id:query-competency-index]`:  
Pattern: "research and report"  
Prompt: `business-analyst/research-and-report.md`  
Protocol: Propose-Confirm-Act

**Workflow:**  
1. I will present a detailed plan for the "research and report" workflow (from the specified prompt).
2. You will review and provide feedback or agreement.
3. I will ask for final confirmation before executing.
4. I will execute only after your confirmation.

I will now read the `[id:prompts_dir]business-analyst/research-and-report.md` file and present the plan. **Proposed "Research and Report" Workflow (Propose-Confirm-Act):**

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Gather from you:
     - research_topic (what to research)
     - scope_boundaries (what is in/out of scope)
     - expected_outcomes (deliverables, audience)
     - timeline (optional)
   - Clarify any ambiguities.
   - Draft a research plan:
     - Scope statement
     - Key research questions
     - Proposed chapter structure
     - Preliminary source list (with URLs)
     - Search strategy
   - Save plan as `[id:findings_dir]/research/research-plan-YYYYMMDD-SSS.md`
   - Present plan for your approval.

2. **Execution Phase**
   - Research and write each chapter, using current web sources (with URLs).
   - Present each chapter for your approval before proceeding.
   - Add approved chapters to `[id:findings_dir]/reports/research-report-YYYYMMDD-SSS.md`.

3. **Finalization Phase**
   - Compile all chapters into a final report (with title page, TOC, consistent formatting).
   - Save as `[id:findings_dir]/reports/research-report-YYYYMMDD-SSS.md`.
   - Notify you of completion and provide a summary of key findings.

**Rules:**  
- All sources must have full URLs (no generic refs).
- All major deliverables require your approval before proceeding.
- File naming uses timestamp format.

**Next Step:**  
Please provide:
- research_topic
- scope_boundaries
- expected_outcomes
- timeline (optional)

Or let me know if you want to adjust the workflow above. Ready to proceed?
