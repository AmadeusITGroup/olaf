Using with Sonnet4 as compared to using with gpt4.1, the initialization sequence is always respected


pppaccau_amadeus: rearch and report

GitHub Copilot: I'll begin by completing the session initialization as required by the protocol, then address your request. **Session initialization complete.** I've loaded the memory map, core principles, and query competency index.

Now addressing your request: "research and report"

**Starting workflow**: Research and Report  
**Protocol**: Propose-Confirm-Act

Based on the competency index, your request matches "research and report" which maps to the controlled research workflow. This uses the Propose-Confirm-Act protocol. ## **Step 1 - Propose**: Research Plan Creation

I'll create a controlled research workflow for you. To begin, I need you to provide the following information:

**Required Input Parameters:**
- **research_topic**: What specific topic or question would you like me to research?
- **scope_boundaries**: What should be included and excluded from the research?
- **expected_outcomes**: What deliverables do you expect and who is the target audience?
- **timeline**: (Optional) Any specific timeline for research and writing?

Once you provide these details, I will:

1. **Create a detailed research plan** including:
   - Scope statement with clear boundaries
   - Key research questions to answer
   - Proposed chapter structure
   - Source strategy (web research for current info + knowledge validation)

2. **Present the plan for your approval** before conducting any research

3. **Execute research chapter by chapter**, presenting each for your review

4. **Deliver a final comprehensive report** with current sources and URLs

Please provide the research topic and scope parameters so I can create your research plan.
