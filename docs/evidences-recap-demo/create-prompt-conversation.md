This conversation is interesting as it shows how I provided inputs to the prompt, how it searched for an existing prompt, and how I steered it to update the existing one instead of recreating it. It failed to do the update and had to remove and recreate. It also shows how i test the prompt with a test prompt. I always do this to make sure the prompt is compliant and complet as per the template and principles.. It should be name check-prompt. Trsting is another think and you need to do it to make sure the prompt is working as expected.
how to assit in really testing the prompt is another work in progress.


<human-user-name>: create prompt

GitHub Copilot: I will follow the Olaf Delegation Protocol as described in `[id:copilot-instructions]`:

1. Session Initialization: Already complete for this session.
2. Competency First: I will consult `[id:query-competency-index]` to identify the correct workflow for "create prompt".
3. If a matching competency is found, I will apply its protocol (Act, Propose-Act, or Propose-Confirm-Act) and inform you of the workflow and protocol being used.

Proceeding to consult the competency index for "create prompt". Match found in `[id:query-competency-index]`:
- Pattern: "create prompt"
- Workflow: `prompt-engineer/create-prompt.md`
- Protocol: Act

I will now execute the workflow in `[id:prompts_dir]prompt-engineer/create-prompt.md` using the Act protocol (direct execution, no confirmation required). To proceed with prompt creation, I need the following information from you:

1. **user_request**: What is the requirement or task the prompt should address?
2. **prompt_name**: Desired name for the prompt (max 4 words, kebab-case).
3. **sub_category**: Please select one of the following sub-categories for organization:
   - architect
   - business-analyst
   - cve-verifier
   - developer
   - dfd
   - evolve-unit-tests
   - other-users
   - project-manager
   - prompt-engineer
   - reduce-code-complexity
   - researcher
   - technical-writer
   - tester
   - troubleshooting
4. **reuse_flag** (optional): Should the prompt be saved for reuse? (default: true)

Please provide these details to continue.

<human-user-name>: 1.  need this prompt to help user to generate a release note  by providing a starting git tag  (commits till this tag are excluded from the release note) and an ending git tag (all commits till this tag are included).
If the starting tag is not provided then start  from the tag before the last one.
If the ending tag is not provided get the last tag 
Look in the templates_dir if there is a release notes tempaple . If not, create one  and store it in the templates_dir and refere to it in your prompt.
The release note  have  at least the following sections: 
- objective: a very consice (less than 20 words) summay of teh benefit of this release
- New features - with small description
- Evolutions - code or prompts that evolved , were improved 
- Fixes : corrections
- Documentation: new of modified  or deprecated
2.  generate-release-note-from-git-tags.md
3. project manager 
4. yes

GitHub Copilot: **Workflow Started**: Create Prompt - Using Act Protocol

I will now execute the prompt creation workflow. Let me first get the current timestamp and then proceed with the template and principles analysis. Now I'll analyze the template and principles files: Now let me check if there's already a release notes template and check for existing similar prompts: Now let me check for existing similar prompts in the project-manager directory: I found an existing prompt `generate-professional-release-notes.md`. Let me check if it already covers git tag functionality: The existing prompt already handles git tags, but let me check if it has the specific defaulting behavior you requested: I can see that the existing prompt is comprehensive but doesn't include the specific defaulting behavior you requested (automatic tag selection when not provided). I'll create a new prompt that includes this functionality.

## **Proposal**: Create New Release Note Generation Prompt

I will create `generate-release-note-from-git-tags.md` in `[id:prompts_dir]project-manager/` with the following key features:

**Key Enhancements over existing prompt:**
1. **Automatic tag defaulting**: If start tag not provided, uses tag before last one; if end tag not provided, uses last tag
2. **Simplified structure** with your specific sections: objective, new features, evolutions, fixes, documentation
3. **Git tag discovery logic** to identify available tags automatically
4. **Concise objective section** (less than 20 words as requested)

**Template reference**: Uses existing release-note-template.md

**Process:**
1. Auto-discover git tags if not provided
2. Generate git commit analysis between selected tags  
3. Categorize commits into your 5 specific sections
4. Generate release note following template structure

Do you want me to proceed with creating this new prompt?

<human-user-name>: do not create a new prompt adapt teh existing one. Make sure it uses our prompt teamples and prompt principles.
You can adjust eth existing templates 

GitHub Copilot: I'll adapt the existing generate-professional-release-notes.md prompt to include your specific requirements and ensure it follows our prompt template and principles.

Let me first read the complete existing prompt to understand its current structure: Now I'll update the existing prompt to include your specific requirements and follow our template structure more closely: 
```


Made changes.


```

```


Made changes.


```
Let me read the current state of the file to see what's there: Let me check the exact content around the Output Format section: I'll replace from the Output Format section to the end of the file: Let me recreate the file with the complete updated content: 

Made changes.

Now I need to update the release note template to match your specific requirements: 
```


Made changes.

## **Completion Summary**

‚úÖ **Prompt Successfully Adapted**: generate-professional-release-notes.md

### **Key Enhancements Applied:**

1. **Automatic Tag Defaulting Logic**:
   - If `starting_git_tag` not provided ‚Üí uses tag before last one
   - If `ending_git_tag` not provided ‚Üí uses last tag
   - Added git tag discovery commands

2. **Template Structure Compliance**:
   - Applied prompt template format from prompt-template.md
   - Added proper Framework Validation, Time Retrieval, Input Parameters sections
   - Implemented Act protocol execution
   - Added XML-style markup for process phases

3. **Your Specific Requirements**:
   - **Objective section**: Enforced less than 20 words constraint
   - **4 Required sections**: New Features, Evolutions, Fixes, Documentation
   - **Template reference**: Points to release-note-template.md

4. **Template Updated**: release-note-template.md

The prompt now follows our established template and principles while implementing your specific git tag defaulting behavior and release note structure.

<human-user-name>: test prompt

GitHub Copilot: I'll test the prompt we just adapted. Based on the competency index, "test prompt" maps to `prompt-engineer/test-prompt.md` with Act protocol.

Let me first check the current state of the prompt file to see your manual edits: Now let me run the test prompt workflow: Now I'll execute the test prompt workflow for testing generate-professional-release-notes.md: **Testing**: generate-professional-release-notes.md - Using Act Protocol
