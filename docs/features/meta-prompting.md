# Meta-prompting

Allows users to generate their own prompts based on entries they provide, following the structure of prompt templates in a consistent way.

## Available Meta-Prompts

OLAF provides several meta-prompts to assist users in this process, located in the prompt-engineer category:

- **create-prompt.md** - Generate new structured prompts from user requirements following OLAF templates and principles
- **convert-prompt-existing.md** - Convert existing prompts to follow proper template structure and OLAF principles
- **generate-workflow.md** - Create structured workflows from templates with different types (sequential, iterative, decision, orchestrator)
- **generate-mcp-client.md** - Generate a basic MCP client application - this prompt is generated using create-prompt meta prompt but taking as input the windsurf @docs:model-context-protocol integrated documentation
- **generate-crewai-java-team.md** - Generate Python scripts to create and run CrewAI agent teams for Java coding tasks. This prompt is generated using create-prompt meta prompt but taking as input the windsurf @docs:crewai integrated documentation

These prompts are completely adaptable to your own needs and follow OLAF's competency structure.


## Competency Structure

We name this structure a "Competency" - we thought about "skill", "meta-skill", and "capability" as alternative terms.

## Usage


### Step-by-step usage

1. **Select a meta-prompt**: Choose the appropriate prompt from the OLAF library based on your goal.
2. **Provide input**: Supply the required information as specified in the prompt documentation, or provide a markdown file describing what you want to achieve.
3. **Generate output**: The system will create the desired prompt or workflow using the provided input and the underlying template.
4. **Review the result**: Read the generated output to ensure it matches your expectations. Make any necessary adjustments.
5. **Test in context**: Use the generated prompt in your specific context to validate its effectiveness. Expect to iterate and refine as needed.
6. **Interact and improve**: If the model's output is unclear or incorrect, ask questions like "why did you do that?", "was the prompt unclear?", or "why did you not use the template?". Request updates to improve future results.

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Follow standardized prompt-tools-templates structure
- **Customization**: Generate prompts based on specific user requirements
- **Iterative Improvement**: Test and refine competencies over time
- **Reusability**: Create once, use across multiple scenarios
