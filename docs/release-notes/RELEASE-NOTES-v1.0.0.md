**Tag:** [v1.0.0](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/olaf/releases/tag/v1.0.0)  
**Release Manager:** <human-user-name>

## Overview
OLAF v1.0.0 marks the initial release of the Open Language Agent Framework, providing a comprehensive solution for AI-assisted code analysis, security vulnerability assessment, and project management.

- **AI Documentation System (ADS)**: Automated documentation and findings management system for technical analysis and security assessments

### CVE Security Analysis
- **CVE Verifier Toolkit**: Comprehensive security vulnerability analysis system with automated CVE descriptor generation and exposure analysis
- **Enhanced Transitive Analysis**: Advanced dependency chain analysis for identifying vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies and framework integrations
- **Automated Tasklist Management**: Dynamic CVE analysis prioritization based on severity and dependency confirmation

### Architecture & Technical Analysis
- **Chapter-based Cloud-Native Architecture System**: Structured approach to cloud-native architecture documentation with templates and guided prompts
- **Technical Stack Analysis Framework**: Comprehensive technical stack evaluation with chapter-based analysis and decision recording
- **Automated Changelog Management**: Streamlined changelog entry creation and archiving with script-based automation

### Development Tools
- **Workspace-Aware Scripts**: Dynamic workspace root detection for cross-platform compatibility
- **System Time Integration**: Local system time retrieval capability for accurate timestamp management in LLM interactions
- **GitHub Integration**: Specialized prompts and delegation protocols for GitHub-based development workflows

##  Enhancements

### Developer Experience
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: All scripts automatically detect workspace root, eliminating hardcoded path dependencies
- **Standardized Templates**: Consistent template structure across all role-based competencies (architect, developer, project manager, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed usage instructions and examples for all tools and workflows

### Security & Compliance
- **Multi-Source CVE Research**: Integration with multiple vulnerability databases for comprehensive threat assessment
- **Evidence-Based Risk Classification**: Structured risk assessment with detailed justification and confidence levels

##  Technical Changes

### Project Structure
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between ACK (competency framework) and ADS (documentation system)
- **Role-Based Organization**: Structured directories for different user roles (architect, developer, security analyst, etc.)
- **Template-Driven Approach**: Standardized templates for consistent output across all tools and workflows

### Infrastructure & Build
- **Git Integration**: Comprehensive git-based workflows for changelog management and progress tracking
- **Script Automation**: PowerShell and cross-platform scripts for automated task management
- **Documentation Pipeline**: Automated generation and maintenance of technical documentation

##  Documentation

### Comprehensive Guides
- **README and License**: Project overview, usage instructions, and licensing information
- **Memory Maps**: Structured knowledge organization for AI agent context management
- **Reference Documentation**: Detailed API and workflow documentation for all components

### User Guides
- **Role-Specific Instructions**: Tailored guidance for architects, developers, security analysts, and project managers
- **Workflow Templates**: Step-by-step templates for common development and analysis tasks
- **Best Practices**: Industry-standard approaches for code analysis, security assessment, and documentation

##  Security

### Vulnerability Management
- **CVE Analysis Pipeline**: Complete workflow for identifying, analyzing, and documenting security vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Security**: Advanced analysis of direct and transitive dependencies for security risks
- **Framework Security Assessment**: Specialized analysis for framework-specific security considerations

### Privacy & Compliance
- **Personal Data Protection**: Git ignore patterns to prevent accidental exposure of personal configuration files
- **Secure Development Practices**: Built-in security considerations in all templates and workflows

## File Locations

### Core Components

## Upgrade Instructions

This is the initial release, so no upgrade is required. For new installations:

1. **Clone Repository**: git clone <repository-url>
2. **Review Documentation**: Start with README.md for project overview
3. **Explore Templates**: Browse olaf-core-knowldege/templates/ for your role-specific needs
4. **Configure Tools**: Review and customize scripts in olaf-core-knowldege/tools/ as needed

## Getting Started

### For Security Analysts
1. Navigate to olaf-core-knowldege/prompts/cve-verifier/ for CVE analysis workflows
2. Use olaf-core-knowldege/tools/cve-verifier/Update-Tasklist.ps1 for priority management
3. Follow templates in olaf-core-knowldege/templates/cve-verifier/ for consistent reporting

### For Architects
1. Explore olaf-core-knowldege/prompts/architect/ for architecture analysis workflows
2. Use chapter-based templates in olaf-core-knowldege/templates/architect/ for documentation
3. Reference cloud-native architecture proposal system for structured analysis

### For Project Managers
1. Review olaf-core-knowldege/prompts/project-manager/ for project coordination workflows
2. Use changelog and task management tools in olaf-core-knowldege/tools/
3. Leverage templates for progress tracking and decision recording

## Known Issues
- All scripts require PowerShell execution policy configuration for Windows environments
- Some file operations may require elevated permissions depending on workspace location
- Git integration assumes standard git repository structure and configuration
