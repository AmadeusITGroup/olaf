# Actuator Updates â€” Phase 2

## Preferred approach
1. Review actuator endpoints and security constraints for Boot 3.
2. Update configuration keys changed in Boot 3.

## Backup option
- Keep legacy endpoints behind compatibility config temporarily and phase out.

## Verify
- Actuator endpoints function and are secured appropriately.
