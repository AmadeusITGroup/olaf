# Modernization Opportunities â€” Catalog for JDK 21 era

## Preferred approach
1. Survey codebase for applicable modern features:
   - Pattern matching, records, sealed classes, text blocks, switch expressions, virtual threads.
2. Document opportunities with file/class references and a short rationale.
3. Prioritize by impact and risk; plan incremental PRs.

## Backup option
- If uncertain about safety or ROI, capture opportunities only and defer implementation.

## Verify
- Produce `modernization-catalog.md` summarizing opportunities and priorities.
