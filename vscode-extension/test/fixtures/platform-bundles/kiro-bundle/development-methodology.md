# Kiro Development Methodology

## Philosophy
Kiro emphasizes rapid prototyping and iterative development with strong focus on user feedback and continuous improvement.

## Core Principles

### Rapid Iteration
- **Fast Feedback Loops**: Get user input as early and often as possible
- **MVP Approach**: Build minimum viable features first
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Add complexity gradually based on real needs

### User-Centric Design
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Understand how users actually interact with your software
- **A/B Testing**: Test different approaches with real users
- **Accessibility First**: Design for all users from the beginning

### Technical Excellence
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns and maintain loose coupling
- **Performance by Design**: Consider performance implications early
- **Automated Quality Gates**: Use CI/CD for quality assurance

## Development Workflow

### Discovery Phase
1. User research and problem validation
2. Technical feasibility analysis
3. Architecture and technology selection

### Build Phase
1. Create working prototype quickly
2. Focus on core user journey
3. Implement basic error handling

### Test Phase
1. User acceptance testing
2. Performance validation
3. Security review

### Scale Phase
1. Optimize based on real usage patterns
2. Add advanced features based on user feedback
3. Plan for growth and maintenance

## Kiro-Specific Practices
- **Time-boxed Development**: Strict deadlines for feature delivery
- **User Story Driven**: Every feature starts with a user story
- **Metrics-Driven Decisions**: Use data to guide development choices
- **Fail Fast Philosophy**: Quickly identify and abandon unsuccessful approaches
