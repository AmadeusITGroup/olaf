# Template: Detailed Technical Specification

## Context

I have requirement documents for a new feature that needs to be implemented.

**Please provide:**

1. **Requirement Document(s)**: Attach or paste your requirement documents (Markdown format preferred)
   - JIRA ticket exports
   - User stories
   - Business requirements
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Any refinement documents

2. **Project Context**:
   - Project name and technology stack
   - Target audience/users
   - MVP scope and timeline
   - Integration points with existing systems

3. **Codebase Information**:
   - Brief description of existing architecture
   - Key components to integrate with
   - Coding standards and patterns to follow

## Request

Create a **Detailed Technical Specification** document that includes:

### 1. Functional Requirements (Structured by Feature)

For each feature, provide:

- **Requirement ID**: (e.g., FR-001)
- **Feature Name**: (e.g., "Manual PR Import")
- **Description**: What the feature does
- **User Story**: As a [role], I want [capability], so that [benefit]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable criteria
- **Business Rules**: Constraints and validations
- **Dependencies**: What this depends on

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Response times, throughput
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Scalability**: Expected load, concurrent users
- **Reliability**: Uptime, error handling
- **Maintainability**: Code quality, testability
- **Usability**: User experience expectations
- **Compliance**: Audit, regulatory requirements

### 3. Data Requirements

- **New Data Entities**: What new data structures are needed?
- **Data Attributes**: Fields, types, constraints
- **Data Relationships**: How data entities relate
- **Data Lifecycle**: Creation, updates, archival
- **Data Migration**: Any existing data to migrate?

### 4. Integration Requirements

- **External Systems**: What systems to integrate with?
- **APIs**: REST endpoints, data formats
- **Events**: Webhook triggers, event messages
- **Authentication**: How to authenticate with external systems

### 5. Workflow Requirements

- **Process Flows**: Step-by-step workflows
- **State Transitions**: Valid state changes
- **Error Scenarios**: What can go wrong and expected behavior
- **Rollback Procedures**: How to undo operations

### 6. Constraints & Assumptions

- **Technical Constraints**: Platform limitations, technology choices
- **Business Constraints**: Budget, timeline, resources
- **Assumptions**: Things we're assuming to be true

### 7. Out of Scope

- What is explicitly NOT included in this MVP
- Future enhancements for later phases

## Output Format

Structure the specification document with:

- Clear section numbering (1.0, 1.1, 1.1.1)
- Requirement IDs for traceability
- Tables for structured data
- Diagrams where helpful (ASCII art is fine)
- Cross-references between related requirements

## Analysis Approach

1. Review the existing codebase to understand current patterns
2. Identify existing components that can be reused
3. Flag any ambiguities or areas needing clarification
4. Suggest refinements to requirements based on technical feasibility

Do NOT provide implementation code yet - focus only on WHAT needs to be built.

## Expected Output

**Document:** `SPECIFICATION_<PROJECT-ID>.md`

**Structure:**

- Executive Summary
- Functional Requirements (FR-001 through FR-020)
- Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-001 through NFR-015)
- Data Model Specification
- Integration Specification
- Workflow Specification
- Constraints and Assumptions
- Requirement Traceability Matrix
