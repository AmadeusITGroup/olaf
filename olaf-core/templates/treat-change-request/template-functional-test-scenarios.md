# Template: Functional Test Scenarios (Gherkin)

## Primary User Workflow Template

```gherkin
Feature: [Feature Name from Implementation]
  As a [user type]
  I want to [perform action]
  So that [business value]

  Scenario: [Specific scenario name]
    Given [initial system state]
    And [additional context]
    When [user action]
    Then [expected outcome]
    And [additional verification]

  Scenario Outline: [Data-driven scenario]
    Given [parameterized initial state]
    When [parameterized action]
    Then [parameterized expected outcome]
    
    Examples:
      | parameter1 | parameter2 | expected_result |
      | value1     | value2     | result1         |
      | value3     | value4     | result2         |
```

## API Testing Template

```gherkin
Feature: API Endpoint Testing
  Scenario: Successful API call
    Given the API is available
    And I have valid authentication credentials
    When I send a POST request to "/api/endpoint" with valid data
    Then I should receive a 200 status code
    And the response should contain expected data structure
    And the data should be persisted correctly

  Scenario: API error handling
    Given the API is available
    When I send a request with invalid data
    Then I should receive a 400 status code
    And the response should contain validation error messages
```

## Performance Testing Template

```gherkin
Feature: System Performance
  Scenario: Response time under normal load
    Given the system is running normally
    When I perform a typical user operation
    Then the response should be received within acceptable time limits
    
  Scenario: System behavior under load
    Given multiple users are using the system simultaneously
    When they perform concurrent operations
    Then all operations should complete successfully
    And system performance should remain within acceptable limits
```

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

Include scenarios for:
- Invalid input validation scenarios
- Authentication and authorization failures
- Network timeouts and system unavailability
- Data boundary conditions and limits
- Concurrent user scenarios where applicable

## Integration Testing Scenarios

Include scenarios for:
- External system connectivity and data exchange
- Database operations and data consistency
- File processing and data import/export
- Background job processing and scheduling
