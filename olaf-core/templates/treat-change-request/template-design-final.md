- **Database ERDs**: Proper entity relationship notation with cardinality indicators
- **API Specifications**: Complete request/response schemas with data types
- **UI Mockups**: Consistent styling with responsive design considerations

#### Code and Technical Standards
```markdown
#### API Endpoint Example
```http
POST /api/v1/configuration-requests
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
  "requestType": "DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG",
  "environment": "PRODUCTION",
  "configuration": {
    "properties": {...}
  }
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "requestId": "uuid",
  "status": "PENDING_APPROVAL",
  "submittedAt": "2025-10-07T14:30:00Z"
}
```
```

#### Database Schema Standards
```sql
-- Configuration Request Entity
CREATE TABLE configuration_requests (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    request_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'PENDING',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    -- Additional columns...
    CONSTRAINT fk_user_id FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```
