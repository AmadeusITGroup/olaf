# Final Size Decision

## Executive Summary

**Size Classification**: [XS / S / M / L / XL]
**Confidence Level**: [High / Medium / Low] ([XX%])
**Effort Estimate**: [XX-YY person-days]
**Target Orchestrator**: `orchestrator-[SIZE]-[name].md`

---

## Size Calculation

**Total Matrix Score**: XX/25 (from 4-size-evaluation-matrix.md)

**Size Band Mapping**:
- XS: 0-5 points → 1-3 days
- S: 6-10 points → 3-7 days
- M: 11-15 points → 7-15 days
- L: 16-20 points → 15-30 days ← **SELECTED**
- XL: 21-25 points → 30+ days

**Classification Rationale**:
[Explain why this score maps to this size classification]
