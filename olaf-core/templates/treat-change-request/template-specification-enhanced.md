## Additional Sections for Codebase-Enhanced Specification

These sections should be added to the existing specification after codebase validation:

## Architecture Context and Integration

### Security Model Integration

The [feature name] integrates with [system name]'s comprehensive security framework:

**Role-Based Authorization:**
- Leverages existing `@[SecurityAnnotation]` annotation for method-level security
- Integrates with established role hierarchy ([Role1], [Role2], [Role3] roles)
- Uses existing [authentication method] authentication through [configuration class]
- Follows established security exception patterns ([Exception1], [Exception2])

**Security Roles for [Feature Name]:**
- **[Role1]**: [Permission description]
- **[Role2]**: [Permission description]
- **[Role3]**: [Permission description]

### Transaction Management Integration

[Feature name] follows [system name]'s transaction architecture:

**Custom Transaction Support:**
- Uses existing `@[TransactionAnnotation]` annotation for transaction boundaries
- Integrates with established transaction patterns in [transaction implementation class]
- Follows existing transaction isolation levels ([isolation level])
- Consistent with existing service transaction boundaries

### Exception Handling Strategy

Error management follows [system name]'s established exception hierarchy:

**Business Logic Exceptions:**
- `[BusinessException]`: [Usage description]
- `[NotFoundException]`: [Usage description]
- `[ForbiddenException]`: [Usage description]

**HTTP Response Mapping:**
- Automatic translation to appropriate HTTP status codes
- Structured error responses through [exception handler class]
- Consistent error format across all API endpoints

## Implementation Integration Summary

### Technical Feasibility Validation

This specification has been validated against the existing [system name] codebase architecture:

**Security Requirements Validation:**
- **Status**: [Feasible/Requires Modification/Blocked]
- **Available Support**: [List existing security patterns/roles that can support requirements]
- **Constraints**: [Any security framework limitations that affect requirements]
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High] - [Brief risk assessment]

**Data Requirements Validation:**
- **Status**: [Feasible/Requires Modification/Blocked]
- **Available Support**: [List existing JPA/transaction patterns that can support requirements]
- **Constraints**: [Database schema or transaction limitations]
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High] - [Brief risk assessment]

**API Requirements Validation:**
- **Status**: [Feasible/Requires Modification/Blocked]
- **Available Support**: [List existing service/controller patterns that can support requirements]
- **Constraints**: [API design or integration limitations]
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High] - [Brief risk assessment]

**Integration Requirements Validation:**
- **Status**: [Feasible/Requires Modification/Blocked]
- **Available Support**: [List existing integration patterns that can support requirements]
- **Constraints**: [Architectural conflicts or dependency issues]
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High] - [Brief risk assessment]

### Implementation Feasibility Summary

**Overall Assessment**: [Feasible/Requires Modifications/High Risk/Blocked]

**Key Findings:**
- [Number] requirements are immediately feasible with existing patterns
- [Number] requirements need minor modifications for compatibility
- [Number] requirements require significant architectural discussion
- [Number] requirements are blocked by current technical constraints

**Recommended Actions:**
- [Action 1]: [Recommendation for addressing constraint or risk]
- [Action 2]: [Recommendation for requirement modification]
- [Action 3]: [Recommendation for stakeholder discussion]
