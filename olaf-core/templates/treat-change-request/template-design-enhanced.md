## Design Document Enhanced Template (Post-Validation)

### Validation Status Sections

#### Implementation Feasibility Assessment

**Architecture Compatibility Validation:**
- **Status**: [Implementable/Requires Modification/Blocked]
- **Available Support**: [List existing architectural patterns that support the design]
- **Constraints**: [Any architectural limitations that affect implementation]
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High] - [Brief risk assessment]

**Data Model Implementation Validation:**
- **Status**: [Implementable/Requires Modification/Blocked]
- **Available Support**: [List existing JPA/database patterns that support the design]
- **Constraints**: [Database or migration limitations]
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High] - [Brief risk assessment]

**Security Implementation Validation:**
- **Status**: [Implementable/Requires Modification/Blocked]
- **Available Support**: [List existing security patterns that support the design]
- **Constraints**: [Security framework limitations]
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High] - [Brief risk assessment]

**API Implementation Validation:**
- **Status**: [Implementable/Requires Modification/Blocked]
- **Available Support**: [List existing service/controller patterns that support the design]
- **Constraints**: [API or integration limitations]
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High] - [Brief risk assessment]

#### Technical Constraint Documentation

**Implementation Complexity Assessment:**
- **High Complexity Components**: [List components requiring significant development effort]
- **Migration Challenges**: [Database, configuration, or deployment challenges]
- **Integration Risks**: [Potential conflicts with existing systems]
- **Resource Requirements**: [Team skills, infrastructure, or timeline concerns]

**Alternative Approaches for Blocked Components:**
- **Component**: [Name of blocked component]
- **Issue**: [Description of implementation blocker]
- **Alternative**: [Suggested alternative approach]
- **Trade-offs**: [Benefits and limitations of alternative]

#### Implementation Feasibility Summary

**Overall Assessment**: [Implementable/Requires Modifications/High Risk/Blocked]

**Key Findings:**
- [Number] design components are immediately implementable with existing patterns
- [Number] components need minor modifications for compatibility
- [Number] components require significant architectural discussion
- [Number] components are blocked by current technical constraints

**Recommended Actions:**
- [Action 1]: [Recommendation for addressing constraint or risk]
- [Action 2]: [Recommendation for component modification]
- [Action 3]: [Recommendation for technical stakeholder discussion]

### Template Usage Guidelines

#### When to Use This Template
- After initial design has been created and needs codebase validation
- For documenting implementation feasibility assessment results
- When preparing design for technical stakeholder review
- For tracking validation status of design components

#### Content Enhancement Instructions
- Add validation sections to existing design document structure
- Preserve all original design decisions while adding feasibility assessment
- Focus on "Can we implement this?" rather than "How should we redesign this?"
- Document constraints and risks without providing redesign solutions
