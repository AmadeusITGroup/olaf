### Task [ID]: [Clear, Action-Oriented Name]

**Description**: What needs to be implemented and why

**Depends On**: [List of prerequisite tasks, or "None"]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Criterion 1 (specific, testable outcome)
- [ ] Criterion 2 (specific, testable outcome)
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] Tests pass (unit and integration where applicable)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Reference existing codebase patterns to follow
- Key technical decisions or approaches
- Integration points with other components
- Error handling requirements

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests: [Describe what needs testing]
- Integration tests: [If applicable]
- Manual validation: [If needed]

**Optional Elements** (add if helpful):
- Estimated effort (if useful for prioritization)
- Risk level (if there are known technical challenges)
- Subtasks (only if task is genuinely complex and benefits from breakdown)
