# System Architecture: [Project Name]

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the architecture of [Project Name]. It is intended for technical stakeholders, including architects, developers, and operations teams. For a detailed list of the technologies used, please refer to the [Technical Stack Document](./technical-stack.md).

## 2. Architectural Goals and Constraints

This section outlines the key drivers shaping our architectural decisions.

*   **Business Goals**: [e.g., Rapid feature delivery, high scalability to support peak loads.]
*   **Key Non-Functional Requirements**: [e.g., 99.95% uptime, sub-500ms API response times. Reference the full NFR document for details.]
*   **Technical Constraints**: [e.g., Must run on Azure OpenShift, must use existing corporate authentication service.]

## 3. System Overview (Logical Architecture)

This is a high-level view of the system's major components and their interactions.

*[Insert a high-level architecture diagram here, e.g., using C4 model's System Context or Container diagram]*

*   **[Component A, e.g., Web Frontend]**: The user-facing single-page application. Responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions.
*   **[Component B, e.g., API Gateway]**: The single entry point for all client requests. Handles routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
*   **[Component C, e.g., User Service]**: Microservice responsible for user management and authentication logic.
*   **[Component D, e.g., Reporting Service]**: Microservice for generating and delivering reports.
*   **[Component E, e.g., Shared Database]**: The primary data store for the application.

## 4. Component Deep Dive

This section provides more detail on the design of each major component.

### [Component Name, e.g., Reporting Service]
*   **Responsibilities**: [e.g., Asynchronously generates PDF reports, manages report templates.]
*   **API**: [e.g., Exposes a REST API for initiating report generation and downloading completed reports.]
*   **Internal Design**: [e.g., Uses a queue-based worker pattern to handle long-running report generation tasks.]
*   **Data Model**: [e.g., Stores report metadata in its own tables within the shared database.]

## 5. Data Architecture

*   **Data Storage**: [e.g., We use a PostgreSQL database hosted on Azure. Describe the rationale for this choice.]
*   **Data Flow**: [Describe how data moves through the system, e.g., from user input in the frontend, through the services, and into the database.]
*   **Data Schema**: [Link to schema diagrams or definitions.]

## 6. Deployment Architecture

This section describes how the components are packaged and deployed in the target environment.

*[Insert a deployment diagram here showing containers, pods, and nodes in OpenShift]*

*   **Containerization**: Each microservice is packaged as a separate Docker container.
*   **Orchestration**: We use OpenShift to manage the deployment, scaling, and networking of our containers on Azure.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline**: [Briefly describe the flow from code commit to deployment in production. Reference the CI/CD stack for tool details.]

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns

*   **Security**: [e.g., Authentication is handled by JWTs. Authorization is managed within each service. All external traffic is over HTTPS.]
*   **Monitoring & Logging**: [e.g., We use the OpenShift monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana) for metrics and a centralized EFK stack for logging.]
*   **Configuration Management**: [e.g., Configuration is managed via OpenShift ConfigMaps and Secrets, injected into pods as environment variables.]

## 8. Architectural Decisions Log (ADR)

*   **ADR-001: Choice of Microservices Architecture**
    *   **Decision**: We chose a microservices architecture over a monolith.
    *   **Rationale**: To allow for independent development, deployment, and scaling of different parts of the application.
*   **ADR-002: ...**
