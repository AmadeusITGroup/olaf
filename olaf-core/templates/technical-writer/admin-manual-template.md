# Administrator Manual: [Project Name]

## 1. Introduction

*   **Purpose of this Manual**: This manual provides instructions for system administrators and DevOps engineers on how to deploy, manage, and troubleshoot the [Project Name] application on Azure Red Hat OpenShift.
*   **System Overview**: A high-level description of the application architecture, highlighting its containerized nature for deployment on OpenShift.

## 2. Prerequisites

*   **Cloud Environment**:
    *   Microsoft Azure Subscription with appropriate permissions.
    *   Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) Cluster or a self-managed OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Azure.
*   **Required Tools**:
    *   [Azure CLI (`az`)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
    *   [OpenShift CLI (`oc`)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html)
    *   `kubectl` (often included with `oc`)
    *   Helm (if applicable)

## 3. Deployment and Configuration

*   **Deployment Steps**:
    1.  **Login to Azure**: `az login`
    2.  **Login to OpenShift**: Use the `oc login` command provided by your OpenShift cluster's console.
    3.  **Create Project/Namespace**: `oc new-project [project-name]`
    4.  **Apply Deployment Files**: Use `oc apply -f <directory>` to deploy resources from YAML files (e.g., Deployment, Service, Route, ConfigMap).
*   **Configuration Management**:
    *   **`ConfigMaps`**: Store non-sensitive configuration data. Detail the keys and their purpose.
    *   **`Secrets`**: Store sensitive data like database credentials and API keys.
    *   **Environment Variables**: Explain how environment variables are injected into pods from `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets`.
*   **Networking**:
    *   **Services**: How the application is exposed internally within the cluster.
    *   **Routes**: How the application is exposed externally.

## 4. Application Management

*   **Scaling the Application**:
    *   `oc scale deployment/[deployment-name] --replicas=[number]`
*   **Starting and Stopping**:
    *   To stop, scale replicas to 0.
    *   To start, scale replicas to > 0.
*   **Health Checks (Probes)**:
    *   **Liveness Probe**: Endpoint used by OpenShift to check if the container needs to be restarted.
    *   **Readiness Probe**: Endpoint used by OpenShift to know when the container is ready to accept traffic.
*   **Backup and Restore**:
    *   **Azure Snapshots**: Procedures for backing up persistent volumes (PVs) using Azure's snapshot capabilities.
    *   **Database Backup**: Instructions for backing up the Azure-hosted database (e.g., Azure Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL).

## 5. Monitoring and Logging

*   **Monitoring**:
    *   **Azure Monitor for Containers**: How to use Azure Monitor to collect performance metrics from the OpenShift cluster.
    *   **OpenShift Monitoring**: Using the built-in Prometheus and Grafana stack.
*   **Logging**:
    *   **Viewing Logs**: `oc logs [pod-name]`
    *   **Centralized Logging**: The application logs are streamed to the OpenShift logging stack (e.g., EFK) and can be integrated with Azure Log Analytics.

## 6. Troubleshooting

*   **Common Problems and Solutions**:
    *   **Pod CrashLoopBackOff**: Check pod logs (`oc logs`) and events (`oc describe pod [pod-name]`). Often due to configuration errors or failing health checks.
    *   **ImagePullBackOff**: Issues with pulling the container image from the registry. Check registry credentials and image path.
*   **Useful Commands**:
    *   `oc get pods`: List running pods.
    *   `oc describe [resource-type] [resource-name]`: Get detailed information about a resource.
    *   `oc rsh [pod-name]`: Get a shell into a running container.

## 7. Security

*   **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**:
    *   Managing user access using OpenShift Roles and RoleBindings.
    *   Integration with Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication.
*   **Network Policies**:
    *   How to configure `NetworkPolicy` resources to control traffic flow between pods.
*   **Secrets Management**:
    *   Best practices for using OpenShift Secrets and integrating with Azure Key Vault.
