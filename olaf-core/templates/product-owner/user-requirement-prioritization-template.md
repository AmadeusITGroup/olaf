# User Requirement Prioritization Template

## Overview

This template provides a structured approach to prioritizing clustered user requirements based on product vision alignment, business value, and strategic constraints. It helps create a delivery roadmap sequence that maximizes value while considering dependencies and constraints.

## Template Structure

- **Analyst**: [Name/Role]

### 2. Prioritization Constraints

**Strategic Constraints**:
- [Constraint 1]: [Description - e.g., Specific cluster must be top priority]

### 4. Cluster-Level Prioritization

#### Priority Level 1: Critical (Must Have)

**Clusters in this Priority**:

| Cluster Name | Total Score | Vision Alignment | Business Value | User Impact | Feasibility | Constraint Notes |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| [Cluster A] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Any constraints forcing this priority] |

**Justification**: [Why these clusters are critical priority]

**Delivery Timeline**: [Recommended delivery window]

**Dependencies**: [Critical dependencies that must be resolved]

#### Priority Level 2: Important (Should Have)

[Repeat structure for each priority level]

#### Priority Level 3: Beneficial (Could Have)

[Repeat structure for each priority level]

#### Priority Level 4: Future Consideration (Won't Have This Release)

[Repeat structure for each priority level]

### 5. Requirement-Level Prioritization

#### Within Priority Level 1 Clusters

**Cluster: [Cluster Name]**

| Req ID | Issue Title | Score | Vision | Business | User | Feasibility | Sequence | Dependencies |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|----------|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| [#123] | [Title] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [1,2,3...] | [List] |

**Delivery Sequence Rationale**: [Why this order within the cluster]

### 6. Cross-Priority Dependencies

**Dependency Matrix**:

| Dependent Requirement | Dependency Requirement | Dependency Type | Impact on Sequence |
|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| [#123] | [#456] | [Technical/Business/Data] | [How it affects prioritization] |

### 7. Roadmap Sequence

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)

**Clusters/Requirements**:
- [Cluster A]: [Specific requirements from cluster]
- [Cluster B]: [Specific requirements from cluster]

**Success Criteria**: [What defines successful completion]

**Key Milestones**: [Major deliverables and dates]

#### Phase 2: Core Value (Months 4-6)

[Repeat structure for each phase]

#### Phase 3: Enhancement (Months 7-9)

[Repeat structure for each phase]

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Months 10-12)

[Repeat structure for each phase]

### 8. Risk Assessment

**High-Risk Items**:

| Risk Item | Risk Level | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
|-----------|------------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| [Risk 1] | [High/Med/Low] | [Description] | [How to mitigate] | [Backup plan] |

**Prioritization Risks**:
- [Risk 1]: [e.g., Constraint-driven priorities may not align with value]
- [Risk 2]: [e.g., Dependencies could delay high-priority items]
- [Risk 3]: [e.g., Resource constraints may force deprioritization]

### 9. Alternative Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Accelerated Timeline

**Changes to Prioritization**: [How priorities would shift]

**Trade-offs**: [What would be sacrificed]

**Risk Implications**: [Additional risks introduced]

#### Scenario B: Resource Constraints

[Repeat structure for different scenarios]

#### Scenario C: Market Pressure

[Repeat structure for different scenarios]

### 10. Stakeholder Impact Analysis

**Impact on User Personas**:

| User Persona | Priority 1 Impact | Priority 2 Impact | Priority 3 Impact | Overall Satisfaction |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| [Persona A] | [Description] | [Description] | [Description] | [High/Med/Low] |

**Business Stakeholder Impact**:

| Stakeholder | Requirements Affecting Them | Priority Level | Satisfaction Level |
|-------------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| [Sales Team] | [List of requirements] | [Priority levels] | [High/Med/Low] |

## Usage Instructions

1. **Define prioritization constraints** before starting the scoring process
2. **Establish scoring criteria** and weights based on your product context
3. **Score each cluster and requirement** using consistent methodology
4. **Apply constraints** to adjust priorities where strategic needs override scores
5. **Create delivery sequence** considering dependencies and feasibility
6. **Document rationale** for all prioritization decisions
7. **Plan for regular reviews** and adjustment processes

## Best Practices

- **Balance data-driven scoring** with strategic constraints
- **Consider user journey completeness** when sequencing requirements
- **Account for technical dependencies** in delivery planning
- **Maintain flexibility** for market and business changes
- **Communicate trade-offs** clearly to stakeholders
- **Document constraint rationale** especially when overriding scores
- **Plan for iterative refinement** of priorities
