## Framework Validation
You MUST apply the <olaf-work-instructions> framework.
You MUST pay special attention to**:
- <olaf-general-role-and-behavior> - Expert domain approach
- <olaf-interaction-protocols> - Appropriate execution protocol
You MUST strictly apply <olaf-framework-validation>.

## Time Retrieval
You MUST get current time in YYYYMMDD-HHmm format using terminal commands:
- Windows: `Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd-HHmm"`
- Unix/Linux/macOS: `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"`

Use terminal commands, not training data.

Use terminal commands, not training data.

## Input Parameters
**IMPORTANT**: When you don't have entries provided, ask the USER to provide them.
- **user_request**: string - Explicit user request for record creation
- **conversation_scope**: string - Purpose and scope of the record
- **ai_model_used**: string - AI model name used in conversation (must be provided by user)
- **record_purpose**: string - Optional specific use case for the record

## Process

1. **Verify Record Creation Permission**:
   - Confirm explicit user request for record creation (CRITICAL: never create automatically)
   - Clarify purpose and scope of the record with user
   - **IMPORTANT**: Explicitly ask user to specify which AI model is being used
   - Do not attempt to infer or guess AI model - get this information directly from user

2. **Get Timestamp**:
   - Get current time in YYYYMMDD-HHmm format using terminal commands:
     - Windows: `Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd-HHmm"`
     - Unix/Linux/macOS: `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"`
   - Use MCP server tool: `mcp_get-local-time_get_local_time` as alternative
   - You WILL use terminal commands, not training data for timestamps
   - Ensure unique timestamp for each conversation record

3. **Validate File Location Before Creation**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Read `[id:ack_dir]memory-map.md` to resolve `[id:conversation_records_dir]`
   - **MANDATORY**: Verify the resolved path is `olaf-data/product/documentations/conversations/`
   - **STOP**: If path resolution fails or points elsewhere, HALT and ask user for clarification
   - **ENSURE**: Directory exists or create it if missing using create_directory tool

4. **Create New File**:
   - Write file: `[id:conversation_records_dir]conversation-record-[timestamp].md`
   - **Create new file for each record - never append to existing files**
   - Use unique timestamp to ensure no filename conflicts
   - Initialize file with proper structure

4. **Follow Template Structure**:
   - Read file: `[id:templates_dir]project-manager/conversation-record-template.md`
   - Apply template structure to organize content:
     - Complete conversation narrative (never summarize)
     - Accurate dialogue capture (each user request and AI response)
     - All actions documented (tool calls, file operations, searches)
     - File operations listed (created/modified/deleted with relative paths)
     - Clean Markdown formatting with corrected user typos

## Output Format
Follow template structure: `[id:templates_dir]project-manager/conversation-record-template.md`

Structure with logical topic sections:
- Clear headings for each distinct request/topic
- Format: **USER said:** / **AI said:** / **AI did:**
- Numbered lists for actions, bullet lists for files
- Relative paths from project root (e.g., `\ack\prompts\file.md`)

## Output to USER
- Conversation record created: [file path with timestamp]
- Topics documented: [number of distinct conversation topics]
- Actions captured: [number of tool calls and operations]
- Files affected: [number of files created/modified/deleted]
- Record location: `[id:conversation_records_dir]conversation-record-[timestamp].md`

## Record Creation Rules
- Rule 1: CRITICAL - Only create records when explicitly requested by user, never automatically
- Rule 2: Always get AI model information directly from user - never infer or guess
- Rule 3: Create new file for each record with unique timestamp - never append to existing
- Rule 4: Capture complete conversation - include full narrative, never summarize content
- Rule 5: **MANDATORY PATH VALIDATION** - Always resolve [id:conversation_records_dir] via memory-map.md before file creation
- Rule 6: **FAIL-SAFE** - If path validation fails, STOP and request user guidance rather than guess location
