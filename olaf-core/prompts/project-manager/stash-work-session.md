# Stash Work - Project Manager Competency

## Purpose
Create a stash record to pause current work and prepare for new work session, similar to carry-over but with explicit work transition messaging.

## Context
- User wants to pause current work and start something new
- Need to preserve current session context for future reference
- Should communicate work transition clearly

## Instructions

### 1. Session Analysis
- Review current conversation and work done
- Identify key accomplishments and current state
- Note any pending tasks or next steps
- Capture repository/workspace state

### 2. Generate Stash Content
Create stash file with format: `stashed-<subject>-YYYYMMDD-HHmm.txt`

**Subject Extraction Rules:**
- Use main topic/feature being worked on
- Keep to 2-3 words maximum
- Use kebab-case format
- Examples: "olaf-framework", "api-integration", "ui-components"

**Content Structure:**
```
