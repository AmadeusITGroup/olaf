## Framework Validation
You MUST apply the <olaf-work-instructions> framework.
You MUST pay special attention to**:
- <olaf-general-role-and-behavior> - Expert domain approach
- <olaf-interaction-protocols> - Appropriate execution protocol
You MUST strictly apply <olaf-framework-validation>.

## Time Retrieval
You MUST get current time in YYYYMMDD-HHmm format using terminal commands:
- Windows: `Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd-HHmm"`
- Unix/Linux/macOS: `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"`

You WILL use terminal commands, not training data for timestamps.

## Input Parameters
You MUST request these parameters if not provided by the user:
- **source_type**: string|"current_conversation"|"file" - Source of workflow to document (REQUIRED)
- **source_file**: string - Path to file containing workflow/conversation if source_type is "file" (REQUIRED if source_type="file")
- **workflow_name**: string - Name of the workflow/process being documented (REQUIRED)
- **target_language**: string|"English"|"French"|"Spanish"|"German" - Language for tutorial content (OPTIONAL, default: English)
- **tutorial_title**: string - Custom title for the tutorial (OPTIONAL, will be generated if not provided)

## User Interaction Protocol
You MUST follow the established interaction protocol strictly:
- Act / Propose-Act / Propose-Confirm-Act (defined externally)
- Use Act protocol for tutorial generation (low risk operation)

## Process

### 1. Validation Phase
You WILL verify all requirements:
- Confirm source_type selection (current conversation or file)
- If source_type is "file", validate file exists and is accessible
- Confirm workflow_name is provided and descriptive
- Validate target_language selection
- Check access to tutorial template

### 2. Execution Phase

**Source Analysis**:
- If source_type is "current_conversation": Analyze the current conversation for workflow steps
- If source_type is "file": Read and analyze the provided file content
- Extract key workflow steps, user actions, system responses, and outputs
- Identify prerequisites, troubleshooting points, and verification steps

**Template Loading**:
You MUST read and apply: `[id:templates_dir]technical-writer/step-by-step-tutorial-template.md`

**Core Logic**: Execute following protocol requirements
- Apply Act protocol for generation
- Use tutorial template structure exactly
- Populate template with extracted workflow information
- Adapt content to target language
- Include specific commands, file paths, and expected outputs
- Create verification checklist based on workflow outcomes
- Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- Generate timeline expectations based on workflow complexity

### 3. Validation Phase
You WILL validate results:
- Confirm tutorial follows template structure completely
- Verify all workflow steps are documented clearly
- Check that prerequisites and troubleshooting are comprehensive
- Validate content is in requested target language

## Output Format
You WILL generate outputs following this structure:
- Primary deliverable: Complete tutorial following template `[id:templates_dir]technical-writer/step-by-step-tutorial-template.md`
- File location: `[id:findings_dir]pptx-folder/[workflow-name]-tutorial-YYYYMMDD-HHmm.md`
- Content adapted to target language with proper terminology

## User Communication

### Progress Updates
- Confirmation when source analysis is complete
- Status of template loading and content extraction
- Timestamp identifier used: YYYYMMDD-HHmm format

### Completion Summary
- Tutorial file created with location
- Summary of documented workflow steps
- Language used for content generation
- File ready for immediate use

### Next Steps
You WILL clearly define:
- Tutorial ready for review and use
- File location for easy access
- Suggestions for testing the documented workflow

## Domain-Specific Rules
You MUST follow these constraints:
- Rule 1: Always ask for source_type before beginning analysis
- Rule 2: If source_type is "file", validate file accessibility before proceeding
- Rule 3: Tutorial must include specific commands, file paths, and expected outputs
- Rule 4: Include verification checklist with measurable success criteria
- Rule 5: Adapt all content to requested target language
- Rule 6: Use template structure exactly without modifications

## Success Criteria
You WILL consider the task complete when:
- [ ] Source type confirmed and content analyzed
- [ ] Workflow name and target language obtained
- [ ] Tutorial template loaded and applied
- [ ] Step-by-step content generated with specific details
- [ ] Verification checklist and troubleshooting included
- [ ] Content adapted to target language
- [ ] File saved with proper naming convention
- [ ] User provided with file location and summary

## Required Actions
1. Request source_type and validate source accessibility
2. Obtain workflow_name and target_language parameters
3. Analyze source content for workflow steps
4. Generate tutorial using template structure
5. Save file with timestamped naming convention

## Error Handling
You WILL handle these scenarios:
- **Missing Source Type**: Request user to specify "current_conversation" or "file"
- **File Access Issues**: Provide clear error message and request valid file path
- **Unclear Workflow Steps**: Ask user for clarification on specific process steps
- **Template Access Failed**: Provide error message and manual template structure
- **Language Not Supported**: Default to English and inform user of limitation

⚠️ **Critical Requirements**
- MANDATORY: Always ask for source_type before starting analysis
- MANDATORY: Validate file accessibility if source_type is "file"
- NEVER generate tutorial without confirming workflow_name
- ALWAYS use template structure exactly as provided
- ALWAYS adapt content to requested target_language
- ALWAYS include specific commands and expected outputs
- ALWAYS provide verification checklist for workflow success
