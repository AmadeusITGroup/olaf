# Project Complexity Rating

**Purpose**: Rate the overall complexity and criticality of the BIRD project to influence change size classification.

**Usage**: This rating is used as a modifier in the Change Evaluation Matrix to escalate or de-escalate change sizes based on the project's inherent complexity.

---

## Complexity Levels

The project complexity is rated on a 5-level scale:

1. **Critical** - Mission-critical, highly complex systems
2. **Complex** - Sophisticated systems with significant dependencies
3. **Regular** - Standard enterprise applications
4. **Simple** - Straightforward applications with limited scope
5. **Pet** - Experimental, low-risk, or personal projects

## Rating Criteria

### 1. CRITICAL

**Definition**: Systems where failure has severe consequences, extreme complexity, or regulatory requirements.

**Characteristics**:
- **Business Impact**: Revenue-generating, compliance-critical, or safety-critical systems
- **Technical Complexity**: Distributed systems, real-time processing, complex algorithms
- **Scale**: High volume, high availability requirements (99.99%+)
- **Regulatory**: Financial services, healthcare, aviation, defense
- **Team Size**: Large teams, multiple specializations
- **Dependencies**: Extensive external integrations, legacy system dependencies
- **Change Risk**: Any change can have cascading effects across the ecosystem

**Examples**:
- Banking transaction systems
- Air traffic control systems
- Medical device software
- Stock trading platforms

**Impact on Sizing**: 
- Changes scored as **M** → escalate to **L**
- Changes scored as **L** → escalate to **XL**
- All changes require full governance and validation

---

### 2. COMPLEX

**Definition**: Sophisticated enterprise systems with significant technical challenges but manageable risk.

**Characteristics**:
- **Business Impact**: Important but not immediately critical to operations
- **Technical Complexity**: Microservices architecture, multiple integrations, moderate scale
- **Scale**: Medium to high volume, standard availability (99.9%)
- **Regulatory**: Some compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC2, etc.)
- **Team Size**: Medium teams, some specialization needed
- **Dependencies**: Multiple internal and external integrations
- **Change Risk**: Changes can impact multiple components but are contained

**Examples**:
- Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems
- Customer relationship management (CRM) platforms
- Multi-tenant SaaS applications
- CI/CD orchestration platforms (**BIRD likely falls here**)

**Impact on Sizing**: 
- Changes scored as **S** → consider escalating to **M**
- Changes scored as **M** → consider escalating to **L**
- Maintain robust testing and validation processes

---

### 3. REGULAR

**Definition**: Standard enterprise applications with typical complexity and risk profiles.

**Characteristics**:
- **Business Impact**: Supports business operations but not critical path
- **Technical Complexity**: Standard architecture patterns, moderate integrations
- **Scale**: Standard volume, normal availability expectations (99.5%)
- **Regulatory**: Basic compliance (security best practices, data protection)
- **Team Size**: Small to medium teams
- **Dependencies**: Limited external dependencies, mostly internal
- **Change Risk**: Changes are generally well-contained

**Examples**:
- Internal tools and dashboards
- Reporting systems
- Content management systems
- Standard web applications

**Impact on Sizing**: 
- No adjustment to change size classification
- Follow standard governance processes

---

### 4. SIMPLE

**Definition**: Straightforward applications with limited scope and low complexity.

**Characteristics**:
- **Business Impact**: Nice-to-have features, internal productivity tools
- **Technical Complexity**: Simple architecture, few integrations
- **Scale**: Low volume, basic availability expectations
- **Regulatory**: Minimal compliance requirements
- **Team Size**: Small team or individual developers
- **Dependencies**: Few to no external dependencies
- **Change Risk**: Changes are isolated and low risk

**Examples**:
- Internal utilities
- Simple CRUD applications
- Documentation sites
- Proof-of-concept applications

**Impact on Sizing**: 
- Changes scored as **M** → consider de-escalating to **S**
- Changes scored as **S** → consider de-escalating to **XS**
- Lighter governance acceptable

---

### 5. PET

**Definition**: Experimental, personal, or very low-risk projects where rapid iteration is prioritized.

**Characteristics**:
- **Business Impact**: No production impact, experimental or learning projects
- **Technical Complexity**: Can be simple or complex, but risk is contained
- **Scale**: Minimal users, no availability requirements
- **Regulatory**: No compliance requirements
- **Team Size**: Individual or very small team
- **Dependencies**: Isolated from production systems
- **Change Risk**: Failure has no significant consequences

**Examples**:
- Personal projects
- Hackathon prototypes
- Learning experiments
- Isolated sandbox environments

**Impact on Sizing**: 
- Changes scored as **L** → de-escalate to **M**
- Changes scored as **M** → de-escalate to **S**
- Changes scored as **S** → de-escalate to **XS**
- Minimal governance, focus on speed and learning

---

## BIRD Project Classification

### Current Assessment: **COMPLEX**

**Rationale**:
- **Business Impact**: Critical for CI/CD pipeline but not revenue-generating
- **Technical Complexity**: Microservices architecture, multiple integrations (Jenkins, Jira, Bitbucket, OpenShift, etc.)
- **Scale**: Medium to high volume of builds and deployments
- **Regulatory**: Some compliance requirements (audit trails, security scans)
- **Team Size**: Medium-sized team with specializations
- **Dependencies**: Extensive integrations with multiple enterprise systems
- **Change Risk**: Changes can impact deployment pipelines across multiple projects

**Sizing Impact**:
- Small (S) changes → Consider Medium (M)
- Medium (M) changes → Consider Large (L)
- Maintain robust testing and validation
- Architecture review for significant changes

**Review**: This classification should be reviewed quarterly or when major architectural changes occur.

## Usage in Change Evaluation

When evaluating a change using the Change Evaluation Matrix:

1. Calculate the base size using the matrix (XL/L/M/S/XS)
2. Check the project complexity rating
3. Apply the escalation/de-escalation rule
4. Document the final classification and rationale

**Example**:
- Change evaluated as **M** (Medium) based on matrix
- BIRD project is rated as **Complex**
- Escalation rule: M → L
- **Final classification: L (Large)**

---

## Updating This Rating

This rating should be reviewed and updated when:
- Major architectural changes occur
- Business criticality changes
- Team size or structure significantly changes
- Regulatory requirements change
- Scale or volume requirements change

**Review Schedule**: Quarterly
**Last Review**: October 8, 2025
**Next Review**: January 8, 2026
**Owner**: Engineering Architecture Team

---

**Note**: This is a living document. As the BIRD project evolves, this complexity rating should be reassessed to ensure appropriate governance levels for all changes.
