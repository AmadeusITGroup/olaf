# Workflow 4: Implementation (XL)



## Framework Validation
You MUST apply the <olaf-work-instructions> framework.
You MUST pay special attention to:
- <olaf-general-role-and-behavior> - Expert domain approach
- <olaf-interaction-protocols> - Appropriate execution protocol
You MUST strictly apply <olaf-framework-validation>.

## Time Retrieval
You MUST get current time in YYYYMMDD-HHmm format using terminal commands:
- Windows: `Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd-HHmm"`
- Unix/Linux/macOS: `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"`

Use terminal commands, not training data.

## Overview



**Purpose**: Execute all planned work through AI automation for extra large changes



**Input**: Planning documents from Phase 3 (Implementation Plans, Documentation Plan, Test Plan)

## Integration with Previous Phases

**From Specification Phase (Phase 1)**:
- Requirements drive implementation priorities
- Business rules become functional test scenarios
- User stories guide documentation content

**From Design Phase (Phase 2)**:
- Architecture guides code structure and patterns
- API specifications become actual endpoints
- Technical decisions drive implementation approach

**From Planning Phase (Phase 3)**:
- Implementation tasks become AI generation prompts
- Documentation plan guides content creation priorities
- Test plan becomes functional scenario coverage

This execution phase ensures that all planning work translates into actual deliverable software through AI automation, minimizing manual effort while maximizing quality and speed.
