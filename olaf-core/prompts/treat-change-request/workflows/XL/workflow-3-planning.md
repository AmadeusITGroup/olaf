# Workflow 3: Planning (XL)# Workflow 3: Planning Phase



## Overview## Overview



**Purpose**: Create comprehensive execution plans for extra large changesThe Planning Phase transforms the approved technical design into comprehensive execution plans. This workflow creates three essential planning documents that guide the implementation phase.



**Input**: Artifacts from Workflow 2 (approved design)**Input**: Finalized design document from Phase 2

**Output**: Test Plan, Documentation Plan, and Implementation Plans

**Output**: Test Plan, Documentation Plan, and Implementation Plans

## 📋 Task Tracking Reminder

---

**IMPORTANT**: Update the Master Task Checklist in `orchestrator/main-orchestrator.md` (or your working document) as you complete each step:

### Prompt 3-3: Implementation Plans4. Define test data requirements and environment setup

5. Establish acceptance criteria and quality gates

**File**: `../../prompts/prompt-3-3-implementation-plans.md`

**Expected Output**: `TEST_PLAN_<PROJECT-ID>.md`

**Input**: `DESIGN_<PROJECT-ID>.md`

**Key Sections**:

**Output**: Multiple phase plans: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PHASE_*.md`- Test Strategy and Approach

- Unit Test Plan (100+ test cases)

**Validation**: All design components covered, tasks breakdown complete, dependencies mapped- Integration Test Plan (30+ scenarios)  

- System Test Plan (20+ end-to-end flows)

---- Performance Test Plan

- Security Test Plan

## Completion Criteria- Test Environment Setup

- Quality Gates and Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Workflow complete when**:

### Step 3.2: Documentation Plan Creation

1. All 3 prompts executed successfully**Prompt File**: `../../prompts/prompt-3-2-documentation-plan.md`

2. Test plan exists with comprehensive coverage**Template**: `../../templates/template-documentation-plan.md`

3. Documentation plan addresses all stakeholders

4. Implementation plans provide detailed task breakdown**Purpose**: Define comprehensive documentation strategy for all stakeholders

5. Ready to hand off to Workflow 4

**Process**:

---1. Identify all stakeholder types and their documentation needs

2. Map documentation requirements to project deliverables

## Handoff3. Define content creation and maintenance processes

4. Establish documentation standards and templates

**Next workflow**: `workflow-4-implementation.md`5. Plan training materials and knowledge transfer



**Provides**: `TEST_PLAN_<PROJECT-ID>.md`, `DOCUMENTATION_PLAN_<PROJECT-ID>.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PHASE_*.md`**Expected Output**: `DOCUMENTATION_PLAN_<PROJECT-ID>.md`


**Key Sections**:
- Stakeholder Analysis and Documentation Needs
- User Documentation Plan (end users)
- API Documentation Plan (developers)
- Operational Documentation Plan (admins/support)
- Developer Documentation Plan (maintainers)
- Training Materials Plan
- Documentation Maintenance Strategy

### Step 3.3: Implementation Plans Creation
**Prompt File**: `../../prompts/prompt-3-3-implementation-plans.md`
**Template**: `../../templates/template-implementation-plans.md`

**Purpose**: Break down technical design into executable development phases

**Process**:
1. Analyze design complexity and identify logical development phases
2. Create detailed task breakdown for each phase
3. Define task dependencies and critical path
4. Generate implementation prompts for development guidance
5. Establish progress tracking and milestone criteria

**Expected Output**: Multiple implementation plan documents
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PHASE_1.md` - Backend Foundation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PHASE_2.md` - Integration & Error Handling  
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PHASE_3.md` - Frontend & UX
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PHASE_4.md` - Testing & Documentation

**Key Sections per Phase**:
- Phase Overview and Objectives
- Work Breakdown Structure (20-30 tasks per phase)
- Task Dependencies and Sequencing
- Implementation Prompts (specific guidance for each task)
- Testing Prompts (validation for each task)
- Progress Tracking and Milestone Criteria

## Quality Validation

### Test Plan Quality Checklist
- [ ] All functional requirements have corresponding test cases
- [ ] Non-functional requirements (performance, security) are covered
- [ ] Test environment requirements are realistic and achievable
- [ ] Test data requirements are clearly defined
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable and objective

### Documentation Plan Quality Checklist
- [ ] All stakeholder types are identified with specific needs
- [ ] Documentation scope covers entire project lifecycle

## Integration with Previous Phases

**From Specification Phase (Phase 1)**:
- Functional requirements → Test cases
- Non-functional requirements → Performance/security tests
- User stories → Acceptance criteria

**From Design Phase (Phase 2)**:
- Architecture components → Integration test scenarios
- API specifications → API documentation requirements
- Technical decisions → Implementation task breakdown

**To Implementation Phase**:
- Test plan → Quality gates during development
- Documentation plan → Content creation alongside development
- Implementation plans → Development team task execution

This planning phase ensures that implementation is structured, measurable, and aligned with both business requirements and technical design decisions.
