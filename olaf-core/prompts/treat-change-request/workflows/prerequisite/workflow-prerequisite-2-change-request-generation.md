# Workflow Prerequisite-2: Change Request Generation

## Overview

**Purpose**: Structure the extracted information into a formal change request document that **adapts to the natural structure** of the source documents. The output should match the demand type (Epic, User Story, Bug, Documentation Request, etc.) rather than forcing a rigid structure.

**Input**: Artifacts from Workflow Prerequisite-1

**Output**: Adaptive structured change request document

## Prompt Execution

### Prompt Prerequisite-2-1: Change Request Structuring

**File**: `../../prompts/prompt-prerequisite-3-change-request-structuring.md`

**Input**: 
- `prerequisite-1-demand-inventory.md`
- `prerequisite-2-extracted-information.md`

**Output**: `prerequisite-3-change-request.md`

**Template Reference** (NOT rigid structure): 
- `../../templates/template-prerequisite-change-request-adaptive.md`

**Validation**: 
- Demand type correctly identified (Epic, Story, Bug, Doc, Clarification, etc.)
- Structure matches what's actually in source documents
- Source document terminology preserved (not forced into agile framework)
- All extracted information included in change request
- Appropriate sections for the identified demand type
- Missing information marked as [Not Provided], not invented
- No forced Epic/Feature/Story hierarchy if not in source
- Document ready for review and routing to Orchestrator-0-Router
