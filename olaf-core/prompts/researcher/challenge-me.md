## Framework Validation
You MUST apply the <olaf-work-instructions> framework.
You MUST pay special attention to:
- <olaf-general-role-and-behavior> - Expert domain approach
- <olaf-interaction-protocols> - Appropriate execution protocol
You MUST strictly apply <olaf-framework-validation>.

## Time Retrieval
You MUST get current time in YYYYMMDD-HHmm format using terminal commands:
- Windows: `Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd-HHmm"`
- Unix/Linux/macOS: `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"`

You WILL use terminal commands, not training data for timestamps.

## Input Parameters
You MUST request these parameters if not provided by the user:
- **subject**: string - The topic or subject area for ideation (REQUIRED)
- **initial_thoughts**: string - User's initial ideas or description of their thoughts (REQUIRED)
- **codebase_path**: string - Path to local repository/codebase for analysis (OPTIONAL)
- **documentation_path**: string - Path to folder containing relevant documentation (OPTIONAL)

- **research_depth**: string|shallow|moderate|deep - Level of web research to conduct (OPTIONAL, default: moderate)
- **challenge_intensity**: string|gentle|moderate|rigorous - How aggressively to challenge ideas (OPTIONAL, default: moderate)

## User Interaction Protocol
You MUST follow the established interaction protocol strictly:
- Act / Propose-Act / Propose-Confirm-Act (defined externally)
- You WILL use Act protocol for iterative ideation cycles
- You WILL use Propose-Act for final save operations

## Process

### 1. Validation Phase
You WILL verify all requirements:
- Confirm subject and initial thoughts are provided
- Validate access to web research capabilities if available
- Extract 3-word subject identifier for folder naming (kebab-case)
- Get current timestamp for session identification

### 2. Execution Phase

**Session Initialization:**
<!-- <session_setup> -->
You WILL initialize the ideation session:
- Create session identifier: `<subject-3-words>-YYYYMMDD-HHMM`
- Initialize trajectory tracking with timestamp and initial thoughts
- Set up iterative refinement cycle counter
- Establish challenge and insight generation framework
- Initialize source citation tracking for all references used
- Scan codebase if provided to understand structure and context
- Index documentation if provided for relevant content discovery
- Prepare web search strategy based on provided URLs or general topic
<!-- </session_setup> -->

**Iterative Ideation Cycle:**
<!-- <ideation_cycle> -->
You WILL execute continuous refinement cycles until user says "stop" or "save":

**Cycle Structure (repeat until termination):**
1. **Analysis Phase**: Deeply analyze current ideas for strengths, weaknesses, assumptions
2. **Codebase Analysis**: If codebase provided, examine relevant code patterns, architecture, and implementations
3. **Documentation Review**: If documentation provided, search for relevant concepts, best practices, and constraints
4. **Challenge Phase**: Present 2-3 specific challenges or counterarguments based on findings from code, docs, and research
5. **Research Phase**: Query web resources (specific URLs or general search) to gather additional insights
6. **Insight Generation**: Provide 2-3 alternative perspectives informed by codebase, documentation, and web research
7. **Synthesis Phase**: Help user refine and evolve their thinking based on comprehensive analysis
8. **Citation Tracking**: Document all sources consulted (code files, documentation, web resources)
9. **Trajectory Update**: Document the evolution of ideas and key insights gained

**Each Cycle You WILL:**

- Analyze relevant codebase sections for patterns and insights
- Search documentation for related concepts and constraints
