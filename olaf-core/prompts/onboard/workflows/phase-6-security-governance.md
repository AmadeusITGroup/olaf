# Phase 6: Security and Governance Workflow

## Overview
Analyzes security implementations, authentication patterns, and data governance practices.

## Tasks in This Phase

### Task 16: Authentication Implementation Analysis
- **Prompt:** `[id:prompts_dir]onboard/prompts/analyze-auth-implementation-patterns.md`
- **Output:** `analyze-auth-implementation-patterns.md`
- **Description:** Analyzes authentication and authorization mechanisms

### Task 17: Security Pattern Analysis
- **Prompt:** `[id:prompts_dir]onboard/prompts/analyze-security-patterns-implementation.md`
- **Output:** `analyze-security-patterns-implementation.md`
- **Description:** Documents security implementations and patterns

### Task 18: Data Governance Analysis
- **Prompt:** `[id:prompts_dir]onboard/prompts/analyze-data-governance-compliance.md`
- **Output:** `analyze-data-governance-compliance.md`
- **Description:** Analyzes data handling, privacy, and compliance patterns

## Execution Order
Sequential execution recommended:
1. Authentication and Authorization (establishes security baseline)
2. Security Pattern Analysis (builds on auth understanding)
3. Data Governance Analysis (comprehensive governance view)

## Dependencies
- Phase 1-5 complete (foundation through architecture analysis required)

## Success Criteria
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms documented
- Security patterns and implementations identified
- Data governance and compliance practices analyzed
- Security risks and recommendations provided

## Output Location
