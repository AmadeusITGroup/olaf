# Tutorial: Condense Framework

## Overview
Optimize OLAF framework files by reducing token count while maintaining full functionality.

## Prerequisites
- Full OLAF framework file
- OLAF framework installed
- Understanding of framework structure

## Estimated Time
20-30 minutes

## Steps

### Step 1: Invoke Condense Framework
```
olaf condense olaf
```

### Step 2: Specify Source Framework Path
Provide path to the full framework file to condense.

### Step 3: Specify Target Output Path
Indicate where to save the condensed version.

### Step 4: Select Compression Level (Optional)
Choose "conservative", "balanced", or "aggressive".

### Step 5: Review Compression Report
Examine token reduction achieved and sections affected.

### Step 6: Validate Condensed Framework
Test condensed framework with various prompts to ensure functionality.

### Step 7: Deploy Condensed Framework
Replace old condensed version with new one.

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Token reduction achieved
- [ ] Critical markers preserved
- [ ] Protocols intact
- [ ] Competency patterns maintained
- [ ] Functionality validated

## Troubleshooting
- **Excessive compression**: Use more conservative level
- **Functionality lost**: Check for missing critical sections

## Next Steps
- Test with various competencies
