## Prerequisites

- OLAF framework loaded and active
- Work logs, changelog, and job files with activity data
- Progress review template available
- Understanding of project goals and metrics

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Invoke the Competency
**User Action:**
1. Type: `olaf review progress`
2. Or use aliases: `olaf progress review`, `olaf check progress`, `olaf status review`
3. Press Enter

**AI Response:**
Acknowledges request and begins gathering review parameters using Act protocol.

### Step 2: Define Review Scope
**AI Asks:** Review parameters

**User Provides:**
- **review_period**: "past 7 days" or "Q4 2025" or "October 2025"
- **focus_areas** (optional): ["OAuth implementation", "Documentation"]
- **team_members** (optional): ["@DevLead", "@TechWriter"]
- **metrics** (optional): [velocity, quality, delivery]

### Step 3: Data Collection
**What AI Does:**
1. Gathers work logs and activity data from specified period
2. Reviews completed tasks and milestones from job files
3. Analyzes performance metrics (if specified)
4. Collects team member updates from changelog
5. Aggregates data from multiple sources

**You Should See:** Progress on data collection with counts of items found.

### Step 4: Progress Analysis
**What AI Does:**
- Compares actual progress against goals and OKRs
- Identifies major achievements and completed deliverables
- Analyzes blockers and challenges encountered
- Assesses resource allocation and utilization
- Evaluates team performance metrics

**Analysis Output:**
- Goals vs. actuals comparison
- Velocity trends
- Quality metrics
- Delivery performance

### Step 5: Report Generation
**What AI Does:**
Uses progress review template to structure report with:
- Executive summary with key statistics
- Detailed accomplishments by category
- Challenges and learnings documented
- Resource utilization analysis
- Actionable insights and recommendations

**Report Sections:**
1. Overview and Summary
2. Goals Achievement Status
3. Major Accomplishments
4. Key Challenges
5. Team Performance
6. Resource Utilization
7. Recommendations

### Step 6: Planning Next Period
**What AI Does:**
- Sets priorities for next review period
- Adjusts timelines based on current velocity
- Identifies risks and mitigation strategies
- Defines success metrics for upcoming work

**You Should See:** Complete progress review report with forward-looking plan.

## Verification Checklist

✅ **All relevant data collected** from specified period
✅ **Progress analyzed** against goals
✅ **Achievements documented** with evidence
✅ **Challenges identified** with context
✅ **Report generated** following template
✅ **Next steps defined** with priorities
✅ **Metrics calculated** accurately

## Troubleshooting

**If no data found:**
- Verify review period includes actual work
- Check changelog and job files exist
- Ensure date format is correct

**If metrics seem incorrect:**
- Review data sources for completeness
- Verify calculation methods
- Check for missing or duplicate entries

## Key Learning Points

1. **Data-Driven Insights**: Reviews focus on objective data rather than subjective assessments
2. **Comprehensive View**: Multiple data sources provide complete picture
3. **Forward-Looking**: Reviews include planning for next period
4. **Actionable**: Recommendations are specific and implementable

## Expected Timeline

- **Total time:** 10-20 minutes
- **User input:** 2-3 minutes for parameters
- **AI execution:** 8-17 minutes for analysis and report generation
