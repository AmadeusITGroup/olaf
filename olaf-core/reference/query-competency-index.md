# Competency Index

**Last Updated:** 20250911-1338 CEDT

## How to Use This Index

If requested for a competency, you MUST perform the following steps:
1.  **Iterate sequentially** through the mappings below.
2.  For each mapping, check if the user's request contains any of the phrases in the first element (patterns array).
3.  Use the **first mapping** that has a matching pattern. Stop searching once a match is found.
4.  Once a match is found, use the second element (workflow) and third element (protocol) to proceed.
5.  If no pattern matches after checking all mappings, use your best judgment to select the most relevant one.

example:  [["review code", "check code", "code review", "examine code"], "developer/review-code.md", "Propose-Act"]
patterns array: ["review code", "check code", "code review", "examine code"],
File name of the prompt to load and execute: "developer/review-code.md", 
Protocol to use when interacting through the chat with USER: "Propose-Act"
Important note: All prompt files are now organized by role in [id:prompts_dir] subdirectories

## Maintenance Instructions

To add a new competency:
1. Add a new array entry at the appropriate location
2. Format it as: `[["pattern1", "pattern2", ...], "prompt-file.md", "Protocol-Name"]`
3. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp at the top of this file

To remove a competency:
1. Locate and delete the entire array entry for that competency
2. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp at the top of this file
