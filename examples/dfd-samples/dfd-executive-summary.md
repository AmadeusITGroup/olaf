# DFD Analysis Executive Summary - code2DFD

## Key Findings:
- **System Purpose:** Automated extraction and generation of security-enriched Data Flow Diagrams from microservice source code for architecture analysis and understanding
- **External Dependencies:** Git repositories (source code), PlantUML Server (diagram rendering), configuration files (analysis parameters), file system (output storage)
- **Major Data Flows:** Repository analysis → technology detection → parallel extraction → security analysis → multi-format output generation
- **Complexity Assessment:** Moderate-to-Complex with sophisticated parallel processing, advanced security analysis, and multi-format output generation

## Business Value:
- **Understanding Achieved:** Comprehensive architecture visibility for microservice applications with security annotations and multiple abstraction levels
- **Risk Insights:** Security vulnerability detection, authentication pattern analysis, SSL/TLS configuration validation, credential exposure identification
- **Improvement Opportunities:** Automated architecture documentation, research tool for academic studies, development team onboarding acceleration

## High-Level Architecture Overview:
```
