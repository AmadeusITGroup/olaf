research and report on this Yeah definitely we should have registry. We had explored this earlier, and also the MCP gateway proposed by Microsoft https://github.com/microsoft/mcp-gateway both seems to be need here,
atleast we identified below are pending items for overall MCP rollout..
- MCP registry and gateway allow teams to publish their tools.
- FastMCP with stateful sessions is not scalable by default, so we need in-memory storage for scalability and statefulness, we need to see if gateway way could assist with this as well.
- Implement an interceptor to block requests to data sources and address potential prompt-based threats.
- Coordination with the security team is needed for AUDs related to network connectivity and data sources.
And there will be initiative in the train for implementation of some these features..

### User Input

chapter 5 understood AUD as Audit but AUD  mean  something else in our context. Axxx Universialk Descriotor. This is is internal and no LLM understabd it,
But I think the work you di  is still very valid . just replace AUD and AuDs by the audit and audits words

### Planner Response

I'll replace "AUD" and "AUDs" with "audit" and "audits" throughout Chapter 5 to correct the terminology.

*Edited relevant file*

*Edited relevant file*

*Grep searched codebase*

### Planner Response

Perfect! I've corrected the terminology in Chapter 5, replacing "AUD" with "audit" and "AUDs" with "audits". The changes made:

1. **Section heading**: "AUD (Audit) Requirements for Network Connectivity" → "Audit Requirements for Network Connectivity"
2. **Requirements section**: "Security Team Coordination for AUDs ✅" → "Security Team Coordination for Audits ✅"

I verified there are no remaining instances of "AUD" in the document. The content and analysis remain fully valid - it comprehensively addresses audit requirements for network connectivity, data source access governance, and security team coordination as intended for your enterprise MCP deployment strategy.

### User Input

also correct teh reserch plan for teh same

### Planner Response

Perfect! I've corrected the research plan by replacing both instances of "AUD" with "audit":

1. **Scope section**: "Enterprise deployment considerations and AUD requirements" → "Enterprise deployment considerations and audit requirements"
2. **Chapter 5 section**: "How can security teams coordinate AUDs for network connectivity and data source access?" → "How can security teams coordinate audits for network connectivity and data source access?"

Both the research plan and the final report now use the correct terminology throughout. The research content remains fully valid and comprehensive for your enterprise MCP deployment strategy.
