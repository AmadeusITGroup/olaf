## Analysis Statistics

- **Total Files Analyzed**: 39
- **Average Complexity Score**: 1359.3
- **Maximum Complexity Score**: 5825.2
- **High-Risk Files** (>1.5x average): 7

## Risk Categories

Based on complexity scores, files are categorized as:

| Risk Level | Score Range | Count | Recommendation |
|------------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| Low | 0-679.7 | 14 | Monitor during regular maintenance |
| Medium | 679.7-1359.3 | 14 | Include in code review focus |
| High | 1359.3-2039.0 | 4 | Priority for refactoring |
| Critical | 2039.0-∞ | 7 | Immediate attention required |

## Analysis Methodology

This report identifies potential complexity hotspots by combining:

1. **Change Frequency**: How often a file has been modified in the last 12 months
2. **Conditional Density**: The ratio of conditional statements to total lines of code
3. **Complexity Score**: Change frequency × conditional density × 100

Higher scores indicate files that are both frequently changed and complex, which may benefit from refactoring.

### Complexity Indicators

The analysis counts the following complexity indicators:
- Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
- Loop constructs (for, while, do-while)
- Logical operators (&&, ||)
- Exception handling (try, catch, finally)
- Ternary operators

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

For files with **Critical** risk scores:
1. **Code Review**: Conduct thorough review of high-scoring files
2. **Refactoring**: Break down complex functions into smaller units
3. **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
4. **Documentation**: Add detailed comments for complex logic

### Medium-term Improvements

1. **Extract Methods**: Break large functions into smaller, focused methods
2. **Reduce Nesting**: Simplify nested conditional statements
3. **Design Patterns**: Apply appropriate design patterns to reduce complexity
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for files that frequently change

### Long-term Strategy

1. **Architecture Review**: Consider architectural changes for consistently problematic areas
2. **Team Training**: Provide training on complexity management techniques
3. **Code Standards**: Establish and enforce complexity thresholds
4. **Automated Analysis**: Integrate complexity analysis into CI/CD pipeline
