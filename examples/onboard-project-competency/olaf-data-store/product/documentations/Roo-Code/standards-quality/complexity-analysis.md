## Architectural Complexity Patterns

### 1. Monolithic Classes
**Issue**: Several classes exceed 1,500+ lines
- Task class: Core business logic concentration
- ClineProvider: Multiple responsibilities (provider, state, UI)
- webviewMessageHandler: Large message routing logic

**Impact**: 
- Difficult to test individual components
- High cognitive load for developers
- Increased risk of bugs and side effects

### 2. Deep Inheritance and Composition
**Patterns Observed:**
- EventEmitter inheritance with complex event handling
- Multiple service dependencies and injections
- Nested async operations with complex error handling

### 3. State Management Complexity
**Complexity Sources:**
- Multiple concurrent async operations
- Complex state synchronization between components
- Extensive configuration and settings management
- Context window and memory management

## Control Flow Complexity

### Conditional Density Analysis
Based on grep analysis of control flow keywords:

1. **Task.ts**: 378+ control flow statements
   - High branching factor in core business logic
   - Complex error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Multiple async operation coordination

2. **API Providers**: 200-320 control flow statements per provider
   - Complex request/response handling
   - Provider-specific error handling
   - Authentication and retry logic

3. **Test Files**: High complexity due to comprehensive test scenarios
   - Multiple test cases with complex setup/teardown
   - Mock configurations and edge case testing

## Dependency Complexity

### Import Analysis
**High Import Counts:**
- Task.ts: 40+ imports from various modules
- ClineProvider.ts: 35+ imports across services
- Complex cross-module dependencies

**Dependency Patterns:**
- Circular dependency risks in core modules
- Heavy reliance on external libraries (Anthropic SDK, VS Code API)
- Complex service injection patterns

## Cognitive Complexity Indicators

### 1. Function Length
**Observations:**
- Multiple functions exceeding 100+ lines
- Complex async/await chains
- Nested callback and promise handling

### 2. Parameter Complexity
**Interface Analysis:**
- TaskOptions interface: 15+ configuration parameters
- Complex configuration objects with deep nesting
- Multiple optional parameters increasing complexity

### 3. Error Handling Complexity
**Patterns:**
- Multiple try-catch blocks per function
- Complex error recovery and retry logic
- Context-specific error handling strategies

## Performance Complexity

### 1. Async Operation Complexity
**Identified Patterns:**
- Multiple concurrent API requests
- Complex promise chaining and coordination
- Race condition prevention mechanisms
