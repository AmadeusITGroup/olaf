## Performance Testing Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Performance Testing Enhancements (Priority 1)
**Add Load Testing Framework:**
```bash
# Install Artillery for load testing
pnpm add -D artillery

# Add load testing scripts
"scripts": {
  "perf:load": "artillery run performance/load-test.yml",
  "perf:stress": "artillery run performance/stress-test.yml",
  "perf:api": "artillery run performance/api-load-test.yml"
}
```

**Load Testing Configuration Example:**
```yaml
# performance/load-test.yml
config:
  target: 'http://localhost:3000'
  phases:
    - duration: 60
      arrivalRate: 10
    - duration: 120
      arrivalRate: 50
    - duration: 60
      arrivalRate: 100
scenarios:
  - name: "API Load Test"
    requests:
      - get:
          url: "/api/health"
      - post:
          url: "/api/chat"
          json:
            message: "Test performance message"
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring Integration (Priority 2)
**Add APM Integration:**
```typescript
// Performance monitoring setup
import { performance, PerformanceObserver } from 'perf_hooks'

// Monitor critical operations
const perfObserver = new PerformanceObserver((items) => {
  items.getEntries().forEach((entry) => {
    if (entry.duration > 100) { // Alert on slow operations
      console.warn(`Slow operation detected: ${entry.name} took ${entry.duration}ms`)
    }
  })
})
perfObserver.observe({ entryTypes: ['measure'] })
```

### 3. CI/CD Performance Integration (Priority 2)
**Automated Performance Testing:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/performance.yml
name: Performance Testing
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  performance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
