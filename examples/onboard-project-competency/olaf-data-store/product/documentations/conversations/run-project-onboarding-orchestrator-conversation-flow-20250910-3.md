### User Input

run orchestrator 

### Planner Response

I'll execute the orchestrator workflow. Let me first read the current document to understand which orchestrator you want to run.

### Planner Response

I'll execute the **Project Onboarding Analysis Orchestrator** using the **Propose-Act** protocol.

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

I'm starting the **Project Onboarding Analysis Orchestrator** workflow using the **Propose-Act** protocol.

## Step 1: Session Initialization

I need the repository path to analyze. Please provide the **absolute path** to the repository you want me to analyze for onboarding purposes.

The orchestrator will:
1. Check for existing analysis task lists to resume or restart
2. Execute comprehensive project analysis through 10 phases
3. Generate documentation in `[id:product_docs_dir]repo_name]/`
4. Create a complete product overview for onboarding

**What repository path should I analyze?**

### User Input

roo-code

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

Perfect! I'll analyze the `Roo-Code` repository. Let me check for existing analysis and set up the output directory.

## Existing Analysis Found - Resuming from Phase 3

I found an existing task list for the Roo-Code repository. **Phase 1 (Foundation)** and **Phase 2 (Technology)** are already completed. I'll continue from **Phase 3: Testing and Quality Workflow**.

**Current Progress:**
- âœ… Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 1-4) - COMPLETED
- âœ… Phase 2: Technology (Task 5) - COMPLETED  
- ðŸ”„ Phase 3: Testing & Quality (Tasks 6-9) - **READY TO EXECUTE**

I'll now execute Phase 3 which includes:
- Task 6: Unit Testing Analysis
- Task 7: Integration Testing Analysis  
- Task 8: Code Coverage Analysis
- Task 9: Performance Testing Analysis

Let me start with the Phase 3 workflow:

**Key Findings:**
- **Strong Testing Foundation:** 210+ test files with sophisticated mocking
- **Coverage Gap:** No automated coverage measurement (needs @vitest/coverage-v8)
- **Advanced Performance Testing:** Detailed micro-benchmarks for critical paths
- **Integration Excellence:** Docker-based containerized testing environments

## Next Steps

According to the orchestrator workflow, **Phase 3 completion requires user review before proceeding to Phase 4**. 

**Please review the Phase 3 outputs before continuing. Start a new session to proceed to Phase 4: Build and Deployment Analysis.**

The next phase will analyze:
- Build process configuration
- CI/CD pipeline setup  
- Deployment strategies
- Infrastructure requirements
