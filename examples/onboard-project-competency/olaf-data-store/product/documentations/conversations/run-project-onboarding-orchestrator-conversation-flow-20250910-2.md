### User Input

run the orchestrator

### Planner Response

I'll run the orchestrator for project onboarding. Let me first read the orchestrator file to understand what it does, then execute it.

### Planner Response

I'll execute the project onboarding analysis orchestrator. Based on the workflow, I need to start with Step 1: Session Initialization.

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

I'm starting the **Project Onboarding Analysis Orchestrator** using the **Propose-Act** protocol.

## Step 1: Session Initialization

I need the repository path to analyze. Looking at the current workspace, I can see we have the `Roo-Code/` directory which appears to be a substantial codebase with GitHub workflows, configuration files, and multiple directories.

**Proposed Action**: Analyze the `Roo-Code/` repository located at `c:\Users\ppaccaud\coderepos\olaf-test-onboarding\Roo-Code\` for comprehensive project onboarding.

This will involve:
1. Creating output directory: `olaf-data-store/product/documentations/Roo-Code/`
2. Checking for existing task list
3. Executing 10-phase analysis workflow if you agree

Do you want me to proceed with analyzing the `Roo-Code/` repository, or would you prefer to specify a different repository path?

### User Input

### Planner Response

Proceeding with the Project Onboarding Analysis Orchestrator for the `Roo-Code/` repository.

## Step 1: Session Initialization

Let me check for existing task list and set up the output directory structure.

### Planner Response

Perfect! I found an existing task list. **Phase 1 is completed** (Tasks 1-4), and we need to continue with **Task 5: Technology Stack Analysis** in Phase 2.

## Current Progress Status:
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete**: Foundation analysis (Tasks 1-4)
- üîÑ **Next Task**: Task 5 - Technology Stack Analysis
- **Output Directory**: `olaf-data-store/product/documentations/Roo-Code/`

Let me execute Task 5: Technology Stack Analysis by reading the Phase 2 workflow.

### Planner Response

Now I'll analyze the Roo-Code repository's technology stack using the prerequisite files and create the comprehensive technology inventory.
