## ðŸ“Š Merge Strategy & Risk Analysis

### **Recommended Merge Order:**
1. **PRs 01-08** (Low Risk): Can be merged quickly with minimal review
2. **PRs 09-11** (Medium Risk): Require standard review and testing
3. **PRs 12-15** (High Risk): Require thorough review, testing, and careful sequencing

### **Risk Mitigation Benefits:**
- **Early wins**: Get 8 low-risk PRs merged quickly (documentation, fixes, utilities)
- **Reduced complexity**: High-risk PRs can be reviewed with full context of earlier changes
- **Rollback safety**: If issues arise with high-risk PRs, low-risk changes are already stable
- **Team confidence**: Success with low-risk PRs builds momentum for complex changes

### **Total Coverage:**
- **Total PRs**: 15 PRs (reorganized by risk)
- **Total processed commits**: ~99 unique commits
- **Commits kept for later**: 1356f34, 6ed415f (batch convert utilities)
- **Coverage**: Complete analysis of all production-ready functionality since v1.6.0

### **Final Risk Distribution:**
- **Low Risk**: 8 PRs (53% of PRs) - Documentation, fixes, utilities
- **Medium Risk**: 3 PRs (20% of PRs) - Integration and management features  
- **High Risk**: 4 PRs (27% of PRs) - Major features and framework changes
