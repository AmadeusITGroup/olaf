**Extract Structure from Java Monorepo**

Create a prompt that analyzes Java monorepo codebases to extract and document their architectural structure, including module dependencies, package hierarchies, service boundaries, and integration patterns. The prompt should identify key architectural components, data flow between modules, and provide a comprehensive structural overview that can guide refactoring decisions, microservices extraction, or architectural documentation efforts. This would be used by architects to quickly understand complex monolithic Java applications and make informed architectural decisions.

The outcomes must be in a template file - 


The prompt name should be "extract-structure-from-java-monorepo"
The template name should be "structure-from-java-monorepo-template"

So start by teh template and then create teh prompt that refers to it
