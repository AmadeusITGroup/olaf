## Framework Validation
You MUST apply the <olaf-work-instructions> framework.
You MUST pay special attention to:
- <olaf-general-role-and-behavior> - Expert domain approach
- <olaf-interaction-protocols> - Appropriate execution protocol
You MUST strictly apply <olaf-framework-validation>.

## Time Retrieval
You MUST get current time in YYYYMMDD-HHmm format using terminal commands:
- Windows: `Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd-HHmm"`
- Unix/Linux/macOS: `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"`

You WILL use terminal commands, not training data for timestamps.

## Input Parameters
You MUST request these parameters if not provided by the user:
- **code_files**: string[] - List of files to analyze for accessibility compliance (REQUIRED)
- **project_name**: string - Project name for findings report filename (REQUIRED)
- **accessibility_standard**: string - WCAG version to validate against (OPTIONAL, default: "2.1")
- **compliance_level**: string - AA|AAA compliance level (OPTIONAL, default: "AA")
- **output_format**: string - report|checklist|recommendations (OPTIONAL, default: "report")

## User Interaction Protocol
You MUST follow the established interaction protocol strictly:
- Act / Propose-Act / Propose-Confirm-Act (defined externally)
- Use Act protocol for accessibility analysis due to assessment nature

## Process

### 1. Validation Phase
You WILL verify all requirements:
- Confirm all required code files are accessible
- Validate accessibility standard and compliance level parameters
- Check that files contain web-related code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.)
- Verify access to findings template: `[id:templates_dir]developer/accessibility-findings-report.md`

### 2. Execution Phase

**File Operations**:
- Read code files: Analyze provided files for accessibility patterns
- Process file content according to WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Read findings template: `[id:templates_dir]developer/accessibility-findings-report.md`
- Create findings report: `[id:findings_dir]reports/[project_name]-accessibility-review-[YYYYMMDD-HHmm].md`

**Tool Operations**:
- Validate accessibility tools: `npm list pa11y axe-core` or equivalent package manager
- Execute automated testing: `pa11y [url]` and `axe-core` analysis commands

**Core Logic**: Execute following protocol requirements
- Apply Act protocol for direct accessibility assessment

<!-- <wcag_analysis> -->
- Analyze code against WCAG 2.1 four core principles:
  1. **Perceivable**: Check text alternatives, captions, content adaptability, color contrast
  2. **Operable**: Verify keyboard accessibility, timing, seizure prevention, navigation
  3. **Understandable**: Validate readability, predictability, error handling
  4. **Robust**: Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies
<!-- </wcag_analysis> -->

- Generate specific recommendations for violations found
- Provide code examples for remediation

### 3. Validation Phase
You WILL validate results:
- Confirm all accessibility issues are identified with specific line references
- Verify recommendations include actionable code examples
- Ensure compliance level requirements are properly assessed

## Output Format
You WILL generate outputs following this structure:
- **Primary deliverable**: Accessibility compliance report with violations and recommendations
- **Actionable findings report**: Machine-readable findings file saved to `[id:findings_dir]reports/[project_name]-accessibility-review-[YYYYMMDD-HHmm].md`
- **Code examples**: Specific remediation code snippets for each violation
- **Checklist**: Summary of WCAG 2.1 compliance status per principle

### Actionable Findings Report Generation
You MUST create the findings report using the template: `[id:templates_dir]developer/accessibility-findings-report.md`
You WILL populate all template placeholders with actual findings data for model consumption.

## User Communication

### Progress Updates
- Confirmation when files are successfully analyzed
- Summary of accessibility violations found per file
- Timestamp identifier used: [YYYYMMDD-HHmm format]
- Confirmation when findings report is saved to `[id:findings_dir]reports/`

### Completion Summary
- Total violations found categorized by WCAG principle
- Priority recommendations for critical accessibility barriers
- Code examples provided for top priority fixes
- Actionable findings report saved: `[id:findings_dir]reports/[project_name]-accessibility-review-[YYYYMMDD-HHmm].md`

### Next Steps
You WILL clearly define:
- Immediate accessibility fixes required for compliance
- Testing recommendations using pa11y and axe-core tools
- Integration guidance for accessibility testing in development workflow

## Domain-Specific Rules
You MUST follow these constraints:
- Rule 1: All HTML elements MUST have proper semantic meaning and ARIA attributes when needed
- Rule 2: All images MUST have appropriate alt text or be marked as decorative
- Rule 3: Color contrast MUST meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Rule 4: All interactive elements MUST be keyboard accessible with visible focus indicators
- Rule 5: Form elements MUST have associated labels or aria-label attributes
- Rule 6: Dynamic content MUST use ARIA live regions for screen reader announcements
- Rule 7: Page structure MUST use proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
- Rule 8: Skip links MUST be provided for keyboard navigation

## Success Criteria
You WILL consider the task complete when:
- [ ] All required code files successfully analyzed
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 compliance assessment completed for all four principles
- [ ] Specific violations identified with file and line references
- [ ] Actionable remediation recommendations provided
- [ ] Code examples generated for critical accessibility fixes
- [ ] Testing guidance provided (pa11y, axe-core integration)
- [ ] Priority assessment completed for identified violations
- [ ] **Actionable findings report saved** to `[id:findings_dir]reports/[project_name]-accessibility-review-[YYYYMMDD-HHmm].md`
- [ ] User communication completed with clear next steps

## Required Actions
1. Validate all required input parameters and file accessibility
2. Execute accessibility analysis following WCAG 2.1 guidelines
3. Generate compliance report in specified format
4. **Create actionable findings report** in `[id:findings_dir]reports/` with machine-readable format
5. Provide specific code remediation examples
6. Define testing and integration next steps

## Error Handling
You WILL handle these scenarios:
- **Missing Code Files**: Request specific file paths and verify accessibility
- **Non-Web Code Files**: Inform user that accessibility analysis requires web-related code
- **Invalid WCAG Standard**: Default to WCAG 2.1 and inform user of standard used
- **File Access Issues**: Provide clear error message and request alternative file access
- **No Accessibility Issues Found**: Confirm compliance and recommend ongoing testing practices
- **Complex Framework Code**: Provide framework-specific accessibility guidance (React, Vue, Angular)

⚠️ **Critical Requirements**
- MANDATORY: Analyze against all four WCAG 2.1 principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust)
- MANDATORY: Provide specific line references for all violations found
- NEVER ignore color contrast violations - these are critical for users with visual impairments
- NEVER approve keyboard inaccessible interactive elements
- ALWAYS provide concrete code examples for remediation
- ALWAYS recommend automated testing integration (pa11y, axe-core)
- ALWAYS prioritize violations that completely block access for users with disabilities
