# Implementation Strategy: Refactoring Execution Plan

## Objective
Transform the prioritized refactoring roadmap into a detailed, actionable implementation plan. Generate a comprehensive markdown file with iteration-based structure, breaking down each refactoring opportunity into specific actions, tasks, and subtasks for execution.

## Time Retrieval
Get current time in YYYYMMDD-HHmm format using terminal:
- Windows: `Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd-HHmm"`
- Unix/Linux/macOS: `date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"`

Use terminal commands, not training data.

## Input Parameters
**IMPORTANT**: When you don't have entries provided, ask the USER to provide them.
- **output_location**: string - Where to save error baseline results (defaults to [id:findings_dir]reduce-code-complexity/)


## Input Files Required
- **prioritization_roadmap_file**: Path to the prioritization roadmap markdown file (`5-analysis-strategy-2-prioritization-roadmap.md`)
- **output_location**: Where to save implementation plan (defaults to `5-analysis-strategy-3-implementation-plan.md`)

## Previous Steps or Phase
1.  Step 1 : Strategic Prioritization and Roadmap Planning - prioritized refactoring roadmap with phased approach established
2. Expected outcomes: Prioritized refactoring roadmap in markdown format with risk-based categorization

## Implementation Planning Process

### 1. Roadmap Analysis
Analyze the prioritized roadmap to:
- Extract each refactoring opportunity and its details
- Understand risk levels and complexity assessments
- Identify dependencies between refactoring tasks
- Map business impact and technical priorities

### 2. Iteration Planning
Structure the implementation into iterations:
- **Iteration 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Low Risk Quick Wins
- **Iteration 2 (Weeks 3-4)**: Medium Risk Planned Improvements
- **Iteration 3 (Weeks 5-8)**: Higher Risk Strategic Improvements
- **Iteration 4 (Weeks 9-12)**: Final Integration and Validation

### 3. Task Decomposition
For each refactoring opportunity, break down into:
- **Actions**: High-level refactoring activities
- **Tasks**: Specific implementation steps
- **Subtasks**: Granular work items with estimates

## Output Format Requirements

Follow template structure: `[id:templates_dir]reduce-code-complexity/implementation-strategy.md`

The output should be saved as `5-analysis-strategy-2-implementation-strategy.md` in the `[id:findings_dir]reduce-code-complexity/` directory, following the markdown structure defined in the template. Replace all placeholder values (enclosed in square brackets) with actual implementation details, task breakdowns, and resource allocations.

## Instructions for Analysis

1. **Parse the Prioritization Roadmap**: Extract all refactoring opportunities with their details
2. **Group by Risk Level**: Organize opportunities into the four iterations based on risk
3. **Task Decomposition**: Break each opportunity into Actions → Tasks → Subtasks
4. **Effort Estimation**: Provide realistic effort estimates for each subtask
5. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify and document dependencies between tasks
6. **Resource Planning**: Allocate appropriate roles and capacity for each iteration
7. **Risk Assessment**: Include specific risk mitigation tasks for higher-risk items
8. **Success Criteria**: Define measurable success criteria for each iteration and action

## Output Requirements

- **Format**: Well-structured markdown file following the template
- **Detail Level**: Sufficient detail for development teams to execute without ambiguity
- **Actionability**: Each subtask should be clearly actionable with specific deliverables
- **Measurability**: Include effort estimates, success criteria, and progress indicators
- **Completeness**: Cover all aspects from setup through final validation

The final implementation plan should serve as a comprehensive execution guide that development teams can follow step-by-step to successfully complete the refactoring roadmap while minimizing risk and maximizing value delivery.



## Output to USER
- Confirmation: "Implementation strategy and execution plan completed successfully"
- Location: "Results saved to [id:findings_dir]reduce-code-complexity/5-analysis-strategy-3-implementation-plan.md"
- Timestamp: Plan completion time
- Next phase: "Ready for execution - detailed iteration plan with action-task-subtask structure available"
- Summary: Brief overview of implementation approach and timeline structure
