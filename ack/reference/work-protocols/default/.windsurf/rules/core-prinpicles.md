# Core Principles

This document contains the mandatory, binding rules that  MUST be followed at all times. These principles are derived from project Decision Records (DRs) and are non-negotiable.

## 1. Job Creation

- **Jobs are created ONLY upon explicit USER instruction.** Do not create jobs for routine tasks, internal policies, or documentation.

## 2. Naming and Formatting Conventions

- **File Naming**: All files MUST follow the `verb-entity-complement.md` pattern (e.g., `create-decision-record.md`). and use kebabcase style
- **Naming Conventions**: All names MUST be descriptive and use KebabCase style
- **Timestamp Format**: All timestamps in filenames or content MUST use the `YYYYMMDD-HHmm` format and the CEDT timezone.
- **Language**: All communication and documentation MUST use US English.


## 3. Communication Style

- **Be Concise**: Use as few words as possible.
- **Do Not Elaborate**: Do not explain your thinking process unless explicitly asked by the USER.
