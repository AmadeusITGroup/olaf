**Plan Version**: [e.g., 1.0]
**Date Created/Revised**: YYYYMMDD
**Author(s)**: [@Name]
**Reviewer(s)**: [@Name]

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
*This document outlines the plan for testing [Project Name / Feature Name / Release Version]. It describes the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended testing activities.*

### 1.2. Scope of Testing
*   **What will be tested?** (e.g., Specific features, modules, user stories, bug fixes)
*   **What will NOT be tested?** (Explicitly out of scope for this test plan)

## 2. Test Items
*List the specific software components, features, or documents that are the target of testing.*
*   [e.g., User Authentication Module v1.2]
*   [e.g., API Endpoint /api/users]
*   [e.g., Functional Specification for Feature X]

## 3. Features to be Tested
*List the features or functional areas that will be tested.*
*   Feature 1: [Brief description or reference to specification]
*   Feature 2: [Brief description or reference to specification]

## 4. Features Not to be Tested (Out of Scope)
*List features or areas explicitly not being tested under this plan and why.*
*   Feature X: [Reason - e.g., covered in another test plan, deferred, low risk]

## 5. Test Approach / Strategy
*Describe the overall testing strategy.*
*   **Types of Testing**:
    *   [ ] Unit Testing (Scope/Responsibility: Developers)
    *   [ ] Integration Testing (Scope/Responsibility: Dev/QA)
    *   [ ] System Testing (Scope/Responsibility: QA)
    *   [ ] User Acceptance Testing (UAT) (Scope/Responsibility: Product Owner/Users)
    *   [ ] Performance Testing (Scope/Responsibility: QA/Performance Team)
    *   [ ] Security Testing (Scope/Responsibility: QA/Security Team)
    *   [ ] Usability Testing (Scope/Responsibility: UX/QA)
    *   [ ] Other: [Specify]
*   **Testing Tools (If any)**: [e.g., Selenium, JUnit, Postman, JMeter]
*   **Automation Approach (If any)**:

## 6. Test Environment
*Describe the hardware, software, network configurations, and data required for the test environment.*
*   **Hardware**:
*   **Software**:
*   **Network**:
*   **Test Data Setup**:

## 7. Test Case Design
*   **Test Case Source**: [e.g., Based on functional specifications, user stories, risk analysis]
*   **Test Case Management**: [Link to test case repository, e.g., TestRail, Jira, Spreadsheet]
*   **Test Case Naming Convention**:

## 8. Entry and Exit Criteria

### 8.1. Entry Criteria (Prerequisites for starting testing)
*   [e.g., Code deployed to test environment, Unit tests passed, Test data available]

### 8.2. Exit Criteria (Conditions for considering testing complete)
*   [e.g., X% of test cases passed, All critical/high bugs resolved, UAT sign-off]

## 9. Suspension and Resumption Criteria

### 9.1. Suspension Criteria (When to pause testing)
*   [e.g., Critical bug blocks further testing, Test environment unstable]

### 9.2. Resumption Criteria (When to resume testing)
*   [e.g., Blocking bug fixed and verified, Test environment stable]

## 10. Test Deliverables
*List the documents and artifacts that will be produced as part of the testing process.*
*   Test Plan (this document)
*   Test Cases
*   Test Execution Logs
*   Bug Reports
*   Test Summary Report

## 11. Schedule (Optional)
*Outline key testing milestones and deadlines.*
*   Test Planning Complete: YYYYMMDD
*   Test Case Development Complete: YYYYMMDD
*   Test Execution Start: YYYYMMDD
*   Test Execution End: YYYYMMDD
*   Test Reporting: YYYYMMDD

## 12. Responsibilities
*Define roles and responsibilities for testing activities.*
*   **Test Lead/Manager**: [@Name] - [Responsibilities]
*   **QA Tester(s)**: [@Name(s)] - [Responsibilities]
*   **Developer(s)**: [Support for bug fixing, unit testing]
*   **Product Owner/User(s)**: [UAT execution, feedback]

## 13. Risks and Contingencies
*Identify potential risks to the testing process and outline contingency plans.*
| Risk ID | Description of Risk          | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation/Contingency Plan |
| :------ | :--------------------------- | :--------- | :----- | :-------------------------- |
| TR1     | [e.g., Test environment delay] | M          | H      | [Plan B]                    |
| TR2     | [e.g., Lack of test data]    | L          | M      | [Plan B]                    |
