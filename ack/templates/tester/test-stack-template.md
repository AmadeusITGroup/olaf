# Test Strategy and Stack: [Project Name]

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for [Project Name]. It details the different levels of testing, the tools used, and the general approach for ensuring software quality.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before running any tests, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

*   **Environment**: A configured development or testing environment (e.g., local machine, dedicated test environment on OpenShift).
*   **Dependencies**: All required services (databases, external APIs) are running and accessible.
*   **Build**: The application has been successfully built and is ready for testing.
*   **Configuration**: Test-specific configurations (e.g., connection strings, feature flags) are in place.

## 3. Testing Levels and Strategies

### 3.1. Unit Testing

*   **What we test**: Individual functions, methods, or components in isolation from the rest of the system. The goal is to verify that each unit of the software performs as designed.
*   **Tools**:
    *   **Framework**: [e.g., Jest, xUnit, JUnit]
    *   **Assertion Library**: [e.g., Chai, FluentAssertions]
    *   **Mocking/Stubbing**: [e.g., Moq, Mockito, Jest Mocks]
*   **How we test**:
    *   Tests are co-located with the source code.
    *   Dependencies are mocked or stubbed to ensure isolation.
    *   Tests are executed as part of the pre-commit hooks and in the CI pipeline.

### 3.2. Integration Testing

*   **What we test**: The interaction between integrated components or modules. This includes testing interactions with databases, file systems, or external APIs (when not mocked).
*   **Tools**:
    *   **Framework**: [e.g., Jest, xUnit, Testcontainers]
*   **How we test**:
    *   Tests may require a running database or other services, often spun up ephemerally using tools like Testcontainers.
    *   Focus is on data flow and communication between modules.

### 3.3. API Testing

*   **What we test**: The application's API endpoints (e.g., REST, GraphQL) to verify functionality, reliability, performance, and security.
*   **Tools**:
    *   **Framework**: [e.g., Supertest, REST Assured, Postman/Newman]
*   **How we test**:
    *   Tests are written to cover all API endpoints and HTTP methods.
    *   Assertions are made on response status codes, headers, and body content.
    *   Tests cover both happy paths and error scenarios.

### 3.4. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

*   **What we test**: Complete user workflows from start to finish, simulating real user scenarios in a production-like environment.
*   **Tools**:
    *   **Framework**: [e.g., Cypress, Playwright, Selenium]
*   **How we test**:
    *   Tests are written from the user's perspective, interacting with the UI.
    *   The entire application stack (frontend, backend, database) is involved.
    *   Tests are run against a fully deployed application in a dedicated test environment.

## 4. Mocking and Stubbing Strategy

*   **When to Mock**: Dependencies are mocked in unit tests to ensure isolation and speed. External services that are unavailable, slow, or non-deterministic in a test environment are also candidates for mocking during integration or E2E tests.
*   **Tools**:
    *   **Unit Test Mocks**: [e.g., Jest Mocks, Moq] for mocking classes and functions.
    *   **API Mocks**: [e.g., Mock Service Worker (MSW), WireMock] for mocking HTTP APIs.
