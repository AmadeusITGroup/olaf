## Architecture Overview

[A description of the system's architecture, including its main components and how they interact.]

### Core Components
*   **[Component A, e.g., API Server]**: [Brief description of its role and technology.]
*   **[Component B, e.g., Web Client]**: [Brief description of its role and technology.]
*   **[Component C, e.g., Database]**: [Brief description of its role and technology.]

### Development Workflow
*   **Build Process**: [e.g., TypeScript compilation to JavaScript.]
*   **Development Environment**: [e.g., Hot-reload development with ts-node.]
*   **Configuration**: [e.g., Environment variables managed with dotenv.]

## Next Steps

1.  **Expand Analysis**: [e.g., Include other project components not yet analyzed.]
2.  **Dependency Audit**: [e.g., Review all dependencies for security vulnerabilities and license compatibility.]
3.  **Architecture Documentation**: [e.g., Create detailed diagrams of component interactions.]
4.  **Testing Strategy Review**: [e.g., Ensure test coverage aligns with the identified stack.]
