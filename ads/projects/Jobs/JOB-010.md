# Job Definition and Status: JOB-010 - Create MCP Server: get-time

**Job ID**: JOB-010
**Type**: Feature Enhancement
**Date Created**: 2025-07-03
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-04
**Reporter/Source**: WALLE
**Assigned To**: EVE
**Priority**: Medium
**Current Status**: Completed

## 1. Summary of Current Situation

This job has been completed.

## 2. Blockers (If any)

*   None.

## 3. Key Decisions Made (Since last update)

*   Initial requirements and scope defined based on the MCP Server Questionnaire.

## 4. Goal / Objective

The primary goal is to create a new, functional Model Context Protocol (MCP) server named "get-time" that provides the current local system time through a single tool.

## 5. Description

This job involves creating an MCP server using the TypeScript SDK. The server will run locally, communicating via standard I/O. It will expose one tool, `get_local_time`, which retrieves the local system timestamp and formats it as `YYYYMMDD-HHmm`. The final deliverable will be an NPM package with a basic README.

## 6. Scope

### 6.1. In Scope
*   Scaffolding a new TypeScript project for the server.
*   Implementing the `get_local_time` tool.
*   Supporting standard MCP utilities (`ping`, `cancellation`, `progress`).
*   Configuring the project to be packaged as an NPM package.
*   Writing a `README.md` file with setup and usage instructions.
*   Creating unit and integration tests.

### 6.2. Out of Scope
*   Support for any transport protocol other than stdio (e.g., HTTP).
*   Implementation of authentication or advanced security features.
*   Support for MCP features like `resources` or `prompts`.
*   Server-side LLM sampling.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new project for the MCP server exists in a `get-local-time/` directory.
2.  The `get_local_time` tool is implemented and returns the current system time in `YYYYMMDD-HHmm` format when called.
3.  The server can be successfully packaged and published as an NPM package.
4.  A `README.md` file is present and contains clear instructions for installation and use.
5.  Unit tests for the `get_local_time` tool exist and pass.
6.  Integration tests verifying basic MCP compliance (e.g., responding to `ping`) exist and pass.

## 9. Dependencies

*   **MCP TypeScript SDK**: The server implementation relies on the official `@mcp/server` NPM package.
*   **Node.js/NPM**: The project requires Node.js for runtime and NPM for package management.
