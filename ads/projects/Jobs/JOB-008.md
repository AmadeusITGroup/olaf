# JOB-008: Standardize ack Workflows and Prompts

## 1. Goal

Ensure all workflow and prompt files in the `ack/` directory adhere to their respective templates (`workflow-template.md` and `prompt-template.md`). This will improve consistency, maintainability, and the reliability of our agentic skills.

## 2. Description

WALLE's analysis confirmed that many existing workflows and prompts do not follow the established templates. This job involves creating a tool to automate compliance checking and then using that tool to systematically remediate all non-compliant files.

## 3. Tasks

| Task ID | Description | Status | Assigned To |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| T1 | **Create Compliance-Checking Tool:** Develop a PowerShell script (`validate-ack-compliance.ps1`) to programmatically compare files in a directory against a specified template and generate a compliance report. | Completed | EVE |
| T2 | **Generate Compliance Reports:** Run the `validate-ack-compliance.ps1` script on the `ack/workflows/` and `ack/prompts/` directories to produce `workflows-compliance-report.md` and `prompts-compliance-report.md`. | Completed | WALLE |
| T3 | **Remediate Non-Compliant Files:** Based on the reports, systematically update all non-compliant workflow and prompt files to align them with the standard templates. | Completed | EVE |

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- A new script, `validate-ack-compliance.ps1`, exists in the `ack/tools/` directory.
- The script successfully generates compliance reports for both workflows and prompts.
- All files in `ack/workflows/` and `ack/prompts/` pass the compliance check when the script is run.
- The job is marked as 'Completed' in the `jobs-register.md`.
