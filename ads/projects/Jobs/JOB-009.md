**Reporter/Source**: [SACP-197989](https://jira.acme.com/agile/browse/SACP-197989)
**Assigned To**: TBD
**Priority**: Medium
**Current Status**: To Do

## 1. Summary of Current Situation

Job created based on Jira Epic SACP-197989. This job will focus on implementing a pilot for generating functional documentation for Terraform modules using GenAI, following official recommendations from the GenAI team.

## 2. Blockers (If any)

* **Blocker 1**: Need to establish connection with GenAI team (Nadia RAMDANI)
  * **Resolution/Action Needed**: Schedule initial meeting
  * **Owner/Responsible**: TBD

## 3. Key Decisions Made (Since last update)

* Decision to create this job based on SACP-197989 Epic.

## 4. Goal / Objective

Pilot the use of GenAI for generating functional documentation for Terraform modules as part of the e2e eco-system (PaaS Workload, Subscription Management), following official recommendations from the GenAI team.

## 5. Description

This job involves working with the GenAI team (Nadia RAMDANI) to pilot documentation generation using GenAI technologies. The pilot will focus on two main documentation types:
1. A FAQ relying on team history review, with quality review and tuning as needed
2. Documentation generated with the help of swimm.io, with quality review and tuning as needed

The experience and findings will be shared with the GenAI team to help improve their recommendations and guide future documentation efforts.

## 6. Scope

### 6.1. In Scope
* Generating documentation for Terraform modules in PaaS Workload and Subscription Management
* Creating FAQ content based on team history
* Generating documentation using swimm.io
* Quality review of generated documentation
* Feedback to GenAI team

### 6.2. Out of Scope
* Documentation for other components outside of specified Terraform modules
* Implementation of automated documentation pipelines (unless determined necessary during the pilot)
* Production deployment of documentation (this is a pilot)

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

1. Successfully generated FAQ for Terraform modules using GenAI
2. Successfully generated documentation using swimm.io and GenAI
3. Quality assessment report for both documentation types
4. Feedback report provided to GenAI team with findings and recommendations
5. Documented process for using GenAI for documentation generation
