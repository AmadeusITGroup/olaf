## Key Findings

### `create-mcp-client.md` Strengths
1. **Production-Ready**: Includes all necessary components for a production deployment
2. **Comprehensive**: Covers security, testing, and deployment
3. **Maintainable**: Better organized for team collaboration
4. **Extensible**: Designed to accommodate future LLM providers

### `generate-mcp-client.md` Strengths
1. **Simplicity**: Easier to understand for basic use cases
2. **Faster Setup**: Fewer components to implement initially
3. **Lower Learning Curve**: More approachable for beginners

## Recommendations

1. **Use `create-mcp-client.md` when:**
   - Building production applications
   - Working in a team environment
   - Need for comprehensive documentation
   - Security is a priority

2. **Use `generate-mcp-client.md` when:**
   - Creating quick prototypes
   - Learning MCP basics
   - Working on simple, personal projects

## Migration Path
For projects currently using `generate-mcp-client.md`, consider migrating to `create-mcp-client.md` for:
- Enhanced security features
- Better maintainability
- Production readiness
- Team collaboration features

## Next Steps
1. Review both prompts with the development team
2. Update project templates to use `create-mcp-client.md` as the default
3. Archive `generate-mcp-client.md` after migration period
4. Document any customizations made during migration
