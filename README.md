# Open Lightweight Assistant Framework (OLAF)

## Quick Installation

Download the ZIP file and extract the framework folders:

```

```

See [Installation Guide](README-INSTALLATION.md) for detailed steps.

## Executive Summary
OLAF is a simple assistant framework designed to enhance the interactions between users and AI agents through natural language interaction.

- **Open**: Open source and adaptable to any modification to fit your project or organization needs
- **Lightweight**: No specific code, only prompts, scripts and templates - mostly designed and generated by GenAI Agents, but still modifiable by humans
- **Assistant**: It assists humans with simplified prompts and organization of work, while also assisting Agents by providing long and medium term memory and data that the agent uses to construct the best possible context
- **Framework**: OLAF is continuously evolving to incorporate more efficient and streamlined processes, prompts and workflows. It may need to adapt to the underlying agent you use - Windsurf, Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.

## Vanilla incarnation
Here we provide a shallow incarnation that demonstrates the structures and possibilities of OLAF.

**IT IS NOT A PRODUCT**

It can serve several needs:

- **Use as is**: It delivers a set of features and prerecorded prompts and workflows that can be tested and used on your code or documentation
- **Explore to learn or teach basics of prompting**: Interacting with an agent through exercising those predefined features or creating new ones
- **Benchmark agents and LLMs**: By using the features with various combinations of these underlying components
- **Help change management**: By assisting engineers to become more familiar with the notion and usage of agents and delegating part of their complex tasks to AI personas

## How to install
To use OLAF, you need to copy the `/ack` and `/ads` folders side by side with your project.

- **/ack for Assistant Core Knowledge** : this is the folder that contains all the artifacts that are used by the AI to perform their tasks. It is the core of OLAF.
- **/ads for Assistant Data Store** : this is the folder that contains all the artifacts that are produced or used by OLAF to perform its tasks.

Note: If you are working with a version control system (e.g.; GitLab, GitHub, etc.), you can (should) include this into your project.

## Key Features

OLAF provides several key capabilities to enhance AI-human collaboration:

- **Interaction Protocols** - "Act", "Propose-Act", and "Propose-Confirm-Act" protocols for different safety levels
- **Meta-prompting** - Generate custom prompts following OLAF structure
- **Memory-map** - Project navigation aid for AI agents
- **Competency-Driven Workflow** - Central dispatcher for mapping requests to workflows
- **Chapter Mode** - Handle long-running processes with context management

**ðŸ“– For detailed feature descriptions, see [docs/features.md](docs/features.md)**


## Available Competencies

OLAF provides competencies across multiple categories including Code Analysis, Documentation & Specification, Requirements Analysis, Project Management, and Software Development.

**ðŸ“– For the complete list of competencies, see [docs/competencies.md](docs/competencies.md)**


## Integration with agents

OLAF integrates with various AI agents through core configuration files and helper prompts. The framework has been tested with different models showing varying levels of compatibility.

**ðŸ“– For detailed integration information, see [docs/integration.md](docs/integration.md)**


## Step-by-Step Getting Started

1. **Copy the `/ack` and `/ads` folders alongside a repository** - DO NOT change these folders' structure initially
2. **Use windsurf (preferred) or GitHub Copilot in Agent Mode** - Configure agent-specific files carefully
3. **Read the configuration files** - Understand project context and memory map
4. **Explore competencies** - Try simple tasks like research-and-report
5. **Manage outputs** - Find and organize competency outputs appropriately
6. **Create changelog and jobs** - Use project management features
7. **You're ready to go!** - Explore other features and create new competencies

**ðŸ“– For detailed getting started instructions, see [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md)**

## Critical Notes
- **This is a work in progress** and we are still exploring the best way to use OLAF. You need to **read carefully and understand what the AI answers**. Avoid just entering the 'YES/DO it/Correct/OK' without really reading. This is not a Genius, THIS is an Assistant.
- Models may fail to answer (resource limit, latency, etc.). Most agents gracefully handle this but you may need to retry. Don't blame your OLAF assistant.

## Best Practices
Key practices for effective OLAF usage:

1. **Maintain Clear Documentation** - Use consistent markdown formatting for all prompts
2. **Document Prompt Authorship** - Include author and date information in prompts  
3. **Version Control Everything** - Track all changes including OLAF-generated modifications
4. **Use Standardized Templates** - Ensure consistency across competency outputs
5. **Follow Persona-Specific Workflows** - Maintain engaging AI persona interactions

## Future Development and Support
This repository is not actively maintained or developed. The goal is to share a base set that can be transformed, expanded, and modified by any solo, pro users, or enterprises.

No official support is provided. While we appreciate contributions, we cannot guarantee that any issues or pull requests will be addressed.

**ðŸ“– For limitations and support details, see [docs/limitations.md](docs/limitations.md)**


## Limitations (as of Q2 2025)

Key limitations include competency stability, model compatibility, context management challenges, and directory structure dependencies.
