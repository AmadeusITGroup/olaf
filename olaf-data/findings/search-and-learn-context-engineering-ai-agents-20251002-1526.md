# Context Engineering for AI Agents - Learning Report

**Generated**: 20251002-1526 CEDT  
**Learning Objective**: Understanding context engineering in AI, especially for developing generative AI agents  
**Current Knowledge**: Knowledgeable in prompt engineering  
**Context**: Learning basics and practical application examples  

## Learning Summary

### Core Concepts

**Context Engineering** is the evolution of prompt engineering for complex AI systems. While prompt engineering focuses on writing effective instructions for single tasks, context engineering manages the entire context state across multiple turns and extended interactions.

**Key Definition**: Context engineering is the art and science of curating what information goes into the limited context window from a constantly evolving universe of possible information.

### Context vs. Prompt Engineering

| Aspect | Prompt Engineering | Context Engineering |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Scope** | Single task instructions | Multi-turn system state management |
| **Focus** | Writing effective prompts | Managing entire context window |
| **Use Case** | "Write a professional email" | Customer service bot with memory, tools, and history |
| **Components** | System prompts mainly | System instructions, tools, message history, external data, MCP |

### The Context Window Challenge

**Attention Budget Limitation**: LLMs have finite attention capacity that degrades as context grows:
- **Context Rot**: Model accuracy decreases as token count increases
- **n² Complexity**: Every token attends to every other token (transformer architecture)
- **Performance Gradient**: Models remain capable but show reduced precision at longer contexts

**Research Findings**:
- Databricks study: Model correctness drops around 32,000 tokens for Llama 3.1 405b
- Smaller models hit limits much earlier
- Performance degradation occurs well before context window limits

## Context Engineering Techniques

### 1. **Compaction**
**Definition**: Summarizing conversation contents when nearing context limits and reinitiating with compressed summary.

**Implementation**:
- Preserve architectural decisions, unresolved bugs, implementation details
- Discard redundant tool outputs and messages
- Continue with compressed context + recent files
- **Example**: Claude Code maintains continuity by compressing message history while keeping 5 most recent files

**Best Practices**:
- Start with maximizing recall (capture everything relevant)
- Iterate to improve precision (eliminate superfluous content)
- Tool result clearing is safest form of compaction

### 2. **Structured Note-Taking (Agentic Memory)**
**Definition**: Agent regularly writes notes persisted outside context window, retrieved when needed.

**Implementation**:
- Maintain NOTES.md files or to-do lists
- Track progress across complex tasks
- Preserve critical context and dependencies
- **Example**: Claude playing Pokémon maintains precise tallies, maps, achievements across thousands of steps

**Benefits**:
- Persistent memory with minimal overhead
- Coherence across context resets
- Enables long-horizon strategies

### 3. **Multi-Agent Architectures**
**Definition**: Specialized sub-agents handle focused tasks with clean context windows.

**Structure**:
- Main agent coordinates with high-level plan
- Sub-agents perform deep technical work
- Each sub-agent explores extensively but returns condensed summaries (1,000-2,000 tokens)
- Clear separation of concerns

**Use Cases**: Complex research and analysis where parallel exploration is beneficial

### 4. **Context Validation and Management**

**Tool Loadout Management**:
- Use RAG techniques for tool descriptions
- Store tool descriptions in vector databases
- Select only relevant tools (keep under 30 tools for optimal performance)
- **Research Finding**: 3x better tool selection accuracy with curated tool sets

**Context Quarantine**:
- Isolate different context types in separate threads
- Validate information before adding to long-term memory
- Start fresh threads when detecting potential poisoning

## Common Context Failures

### 1. **Context Poisoning**
**Problem**: Hallucinations or errors get referenced repeatedly in future responses.
**Solution**: Context validation and quarantine systems.

### 2. **Context Distraction**
**Problem**: Large context causes model to focus on accumulated history instead of training knowledge.
**Solution**: Context summarization to compress information while maintaining important details.

### 3. **Context Confusion**
**Problem**: Extra irrelevant information leads to poor responses.
**Solution**: Tool loadout management using RAG techniques.

### 4. **Context Clash**
**Problem**: Conflicting information within context window.
**Solution**: Structured context organization and conflict resolution protocols.

## Application Examples

### When to Use Each Technique

| Technique | Best For | Example Use Case |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **Compaction** | Tasks requiring extensive back-and-forth | Code debugging sessions |
| **Note-taking** | Iterative development with clear milestones | Project management, learning systems |
| **Multi-agent** | Complex research and analysis | Research synthesis, parallel exploration |
| **Tool Management** | Systems with many available tools | Enterprise AI assistants |

### Practical Implementation Guidelines

**System Prompt Design**:
- Use clear, direct language at appropriate altitude
- Organize into distinct sections (`<background_information>`, `<instructions>`, `## Tool guidance`)
- Strive for minimal set of information that fully outlines expected behavior
- Use XML tagging or Markdown headers for structure

**Tool Design**:
- Self-contained, robust to error, extremely clear purpose
- Minimal overlap in functionality
- Descriptive, unambiguous input parameters
- Avoid bloated tool sets that create ambiguous decision points

**Example Selection**:
- Curate diverse, canonical examples (not exhaustive edge cases)
- Examples are "pictures worth a thousand words" for LLMs
- Focus on quality over quantity
