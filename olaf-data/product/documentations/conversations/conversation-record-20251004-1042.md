## Create User Requirements Grooming Prompt and Templates

**USER said:** "create prompt that groom my requirements in regards of a product vision. The user requirements are gathered in the issues of the github project so you need to get access to it using the github MCP server. I will install it manually so don't bother in your prompt. Once you get all the ones that are in a state of being considered by a product owner (we will base this on the status of the issue), you need to cluster them and prioritize them in regard of the product vision. The user must provide you with location of the product vision. The user must be requested to review the clusterization before the prioritization. For both clusterization and prioritization you first need to create templates that will be used referred in the prompt. This is for the product owner sub category. The prompt should be called groom-user-requirements the template user-requirement-clusterization-template and user-requirement-prioritization-template. The clusterization is about grouping the user requirement together, may be identifying the duplicate ones but keep all, the prioritization is about proposing a sequence to deliver the roadmap. Before prioritization you must ask the user of the prompt if he or she has constraints for the prioritization (e.g. a specific cluster or user requirement that must be on top of the list even if it is not in line with the product vision - in such case he should be annotated as such)"

**Claude Sonnet 4 said:** "I'll create a prompt for grooming user requirements based on a product vision, along with the necessary templates. Let me start by examining the current template structure and then create the required files."

**Claude Sonnet 4 did:**
1. Read the existing product vision template at `olaf-core\templates\product-owner\create-product-vision.md`
2. Listed the contents of the product-owner templates directory
3. Attempted to list the product-owner prompts directory (which didn't exist)
4. Listed the main prompts directory to understand the structure
5. Created a todo list to track the four main tasks
6. Created the user requirement clusterization template
7. Updated todo list to mark clusterization template as completed
8. Created the user requirement prioritization template
9. Updated todo list to mark prioritization template as completed
10. Created the product-owner directory in the prompts folder using mkdir command
11. Updated todo list to mark directory creation as completed
12. Created the main groom-user-requirements prompt file
13. Updated todo list to mark all tasks as completed

**Files created:**
- `olaf-core\templates\product-owner\user-requirement-clusterization-template.md`
- `olaf-core\templates\product-owner\user-requirement-prioritization-template.md`
- `olaf-core\prompts\product-owner\groom-user-requirements.md`

**Files modified:**
- None (all were new file creations)

**Files deleted:**
- None

## Store Conversation Request

**USER said:** "store conversation"

**Claude Sonnet 4 said:** "I'll use the 'store conversation' competency to save this conversation record. Let me execute the appropriate workflow."

**Claude Sonnet 4 did:**
1. Read the store conversation record prompt at `olaf-core\prompts\project-manager\store-conversation-record.md`
2. Retrieved current timestamp using PowerShell Get-Date command (result: 20251004-1042)
3. Read the memory map from `.windsurf\rules\memory-map.md` to resolve file paths
4. Attempted to list the documentations directory (which didn't exist)
5. Listed the existing product directory structure
6. Created the missing directory structure `olaf-data\product\documentations\conversations\` using mkdir command
7. Read the conversation record template from `olaf-core\templates\project-manager\conversation-record-template.md`
8. Asked user to specify the AI model being used

**USER said:** "i use Claude Sonnet 4"

**Claude Sonnet 4 said:** "Perfect! Now I'll create the conversation record with Claude Sonnet 4 as the AI model."

**Claude Sonnet 4 did:**
1. Created this comprehensive conversation record documenting the entire session

**Files created:**
- `olaf-data\product\documentations\conversations\conversation-record-20251004-1042.md`

## Key Deliverables Summary

**Created a comprehensive user requirements grooming system consisting of:**

1. **Clusterization Template** - Structured approach to group related requirements, identify duplicates while preserving all entries, and document cluster characteristics with product vision alignment

2. **Prioritization Template** - Comprehensive framework with scoring criteria, strategic constraint handling, phased delivery roadmap with risk assessment, and alternative scenarios

3. **Main Grooming Prompt** - Orchestrates complete 3-phase process:
   - Phase 1: Requirements gathering from GitHub via MCP server
   - Phase 2: Clusterization with mandatory user review and approval
   - Phase 3: Prioritization considering strategic constraints

**Key Features Implemented:**
- GitHub MCP server integration for issue extraction
- Product vision alignment requirements
- Mandatory user review gates for clusterization approval
- Strategic constraint handling that can override analytical scoring
- Duplicate identification while preserving all requirements
- Template-driven structured approach
- Comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation planning
