- Feature: EVE learned a new skill: Manage Kebab Filenames. EVE can now identify non-kebab-case filenames, propose renaming, rename files with user approval, and update their references throughout the project. This includes the creation of the `kebabCaseFileManagement.md` prompt and the `manage-kebab-filenames.md` workflow.
