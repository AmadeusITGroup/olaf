# Essential Agile Ceremonies for the Project

In a light agile framework, the focus is on maximizing value and minimizing overhead. The following ceremonies are considered essential to maintain alignment, ensure continuous improvement, and deliver working software, without unnecessary process.

## 1. Daily Stand-up (Daily Scrum)

*   **Purpose**: A quick, daily synchronization meeting for the development team.
*   **Frequency**: Daily, typically at the same time and place.
*   **Duration**: 15 minutes (maximum).
*   **Attendees**: The development team. The Scrum Master and Product Owner may attend but are not required to speak.
*   **Process**: Each team member briefly answers three questions:
    1.  What did I complete yesterday?
    2.  What will I work on today?
    3.  Are there any impediments in my way?
*   **Goal**: To coordinate the day's work and identify any blockers. It is a planning meeting, not a status update for management.

## 2. Sprint Planning

*   **Purpose**: To determine what can be delivered in the upcoming sprint and how that work will be achieved.
*   **Frequency**: Once per sprint (at the beginning).
*   **Duration**: Typically 1-2 hours for a two-week sprint.
*   **Attendees**: The entire team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team).
*   **Process**:
    1.  The Product Owner presents the highest priority items from the product backlog.
    2.  The team discusses the items and collectively selects how much they can commit to delivering in the sprint.
    3.  The team creates a plan for how they will build the selected items.
*   **Goal**: To have a clear Sprint Goal and a backlog of items that the team is confident they can complete.

## 3. Sprint Review (Demo)

*   **Purpose**: To inspect the increment of work completed during the sprint and adapt the product backlog if needed.
*   **Frequency**: Once per sprint (at the end).
*   **Duration**: Typically 1 hour for a two-week sprint.
*   **Attendees**: The entire team and any interested stakeholders.
*   **Process**:
    1.  The team demonstrates the work that they have "Done."
    2.  The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands.
    3.  The entire group collaborates on what to do next.
*   **Goal**: To get feedback from stakeholders and to celebrate the team's accomplishments.

## 4. Retrospective

*   **Purpose**: To reflect on the past sprint and identify opportunities for improvement.
*   **Frequency**: Once per sprint (after the Sprint Review).
*   **Duration**: Typically 45-60 minutes for a two-week sprint.
*   **Attendees**: The entire team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team).
*   **Process**: The team discusses:
    1.  What went well during the sprint?
    2.  What could be improved?
    3.  What will we commit to changing in the next sprint?
*   **Goal**: To create a plan for implementing improvements in the way the team works. This is the cornerstone of continuous improvement.
