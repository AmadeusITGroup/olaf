# Home Office & On-Site Work Policy

This document outlines the hybrid work model for our team. Our goal is to balance the benefits of in-person collaboration with the flexibility of remote work.

## Core Rules

1.  **Weekly Schedule**: Team members are expected to work **3 days on-site** and may work **2 days from home** each week.

2.  **Mandatory On-Site Day**: **Monday is a mandatory on-site day for all team members.** This ensures we kick off the week together with direct collaboration.

3.  **Flexible Days**: The remaining two on-site days can be scheduled across Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

## Guidelines

*   Please coordinate your weekly on-site schedule with your team lead to ensure we maintain a good balance of in-person presence throughout the week.
*   This policy is based on trust and flexibility. We expect everyone to adhere to these principles to make the hybrid model a success for everyone.
