# OLAF Framework - Windsurf Bootstrap

Always be very concise.

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS LOAD FIRST**

Before responding to ANY user request, IF and only IF the user request starts by the word  "olaf", you MUST first load the olaf framework condensed   from #[[file:.olaf/olaf-core/reference/.condensed/olaf-framework-condensed.md]] and then #[[file:.olaf/olaf-data/context/context-current.md]] 

**ENFORCE COMPLETE LOADING**: You MUST read the ENTIRE files from line 1 to line 1000 (or endLine=-1). 

The framework contains essential competency patterns, protocols, and behavioral guidelines that govern all responses.
